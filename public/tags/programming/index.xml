      <description>After spending most of this month&amp;rsquo;s dedicated learning time working on system, server, and network activities, I have been itching to start some home programming again. To motivate myself, I even considered dabbling with a new programming language&amp;hellip; and with very little internal debate, I decided to just Gopher it (I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry).
What is GO? Go (sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;golang&amp;rdquo;) is an open source programming language, developed in 2007 by a team at Google (Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months Rebecca (my Fiancee) and I have continued making progress on all the little tasks that we have to complete before our wedding. One of these tasks is asking our intended bridesmaids/groomsmen to be in the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>25 Days of C</title>

      <description>As I continue to learn more and more programming languages, I am somewhat ashamed to admit that I have yet to learn C. However, it is not because I am trying to avoid it.
The Reason C is one of the top languages I wish to know, and know well. C is the backbone for so much code, especially in the Linux ecosphere that it is almost imperative for one to at least understand it.</description>
