      <description>The past few weeks I have been listening to all of the buzz about Ubuntu &amp;ldquo;snaps&amp;rdquo;, but I just recently decided to try this new technology out.
Snapd Install and Setup I decided to install snapd on my small netbook (Abra), which is running Arch Linux. So, installing snapd was as easy as running:
pacaur -S snapd
Now, I use pacaur so that I can install packages from Arch Linux&amp;rsquo;s main repos, as well as the AUR.</description>
