      <description>I have been using ZFS data pools to store data on my server for some time now. As great as that is, I am ashamed to admit that I have not had a true backup system in place (raid/mirrors are not backup). I have a backup solution that I have attempted in the past, but ran into an issue and let it drift to the side. That changes now. It&amp;rsquo;s time to revisit my solution, and complete it to the end.</description>
