      <title>Migrating from Solus to Fedora for now</title>

      <description>For awhile, I have been debating the idea of switching back to Fedora (from Solus). At least on my main computer. First, let me state this right up front: I am still very satisfied with Solus. I think it is one of the best current Linux distros, and I want to still contribute to the project. However, there are a few reasons why Solus isn&amp;rsquo;t the best fit for my needs right now, and I will highlight them below.</description>

      <title>Trying Out the Plasma 5 Desktop Environment</title>

      <description>After watching the continued development of the Plasma 5 desktop environment from a distance, I determined I needed to give it another try. It was just before version 5.6 was released, and the project appeared to be finding it&amp;rsquo;s stride. Right up front, I want to come clean and admit that I have never really liked the KDE/Plasma desktop environment (more on that below). However, with that said&amp;hellip; I am still using the plasma desktop on my main computer (months later, and haven&amp;rsquo;t aborted yet**&amp;hellip;).</description>
