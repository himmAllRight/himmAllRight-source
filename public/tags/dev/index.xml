      <description>After spending most of this month&amp;rsquo;s dedicated learning time working on system, server, and network activities, I have been itching to start some home programming again. To motivate myself, I even considered dabbling with a new programming language&amp;hellip; and with very little internal debate, I decided to just Gopher it (I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry).
What is GO? Go (sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;golang&amp;rdquo;) is an open source programming language, developed in 2007 by a team at Google (Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson).</description>

      <description>For over a year or so, I have been using a self-hosted Gitlab to host all of my private repos. For a few months now, I have been meaning to migrate my Gitlab repos to bare, minimal ones, hosted directly on a server. The majority of my code/configs are hosted publicly on my Github page, and it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to maintain a full Gitlab instance for the few (like&amp;hellip;2) private repositories that I keep.</description>
