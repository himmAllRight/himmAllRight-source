      <description>As I start to do more with a computer on the go, the netbooks I previously used just are not cutting it anymore. They were great for minimal use, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t run VMs, over-heated, and didn&amp;rsquo;t have great battery life. Now that I am going to libraries and other locations to work on personal and open source projects, I really needed a better mobile pc setup.
