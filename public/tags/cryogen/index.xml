      <description>When I first started using Cryogen to generate this website, I wanted to create a personalized theme. This desire led me to hack a the default theme into a mutant, which I boringly named &amp;ldquo;ryan1&amp;rdquo; (I anticipated it to be temporary). It looked like a relic, designed from when I first learned how to make a web page&amp;hellip; the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s. Like many all websites from that time, it was not mobile friendly.</description>

      <description>Ever since resurrecting my personal website, I have experimented with several static website generators. Thus far, I have tried org-page, Jekyll (several times), and even (almost) made my own emacs org-page solution. Now that I have started using the clojure programming language, I have come across cryogen. As you may have already guessed, this site is now being generated using cryogen.
Emacs/org-mode Solutions About a year ago, obsession with emacs (and more importantly, org-mode) eventually led me to try out org-page while revitalizing my personal website.</description>
