      <description>Last week, I was on vacation with my family. While I didn&amp;rsquo;t work a ton on personal projects, I was at least able to spend some time on my TunelBeacon project again. I will write a dedicated post about that project down the road when I am further along. Basically, it will be a simple GUI to create reverse ssh tunnels, that family and friends can startup in order grant me temporary access to their computer when they need support.</description>

      <description>This past weekend, I setup my new ubiquiti network. It actually took up a good portion of Sunday, because I ran into a few minor issues. Fortunately/Unfortunately, these issues were mostly because it my first time configuring this type of setup, and there was a lot of trial and error. The basic network is now all configured and has been running great. It was a good day and I learned a lot :).</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I went back to Pennsylvania for a week to attend my college swim team reunion, and my brother&amp;rsquo;s high school graduation. While I was away, the wifi-router Rebecca and I were using decided to die (of course). When I returned, I setup our old router as a temporary fix. It was terrible. So, I began researching how I should upgrade our network. This time around, I am doing this correctly.</description>
