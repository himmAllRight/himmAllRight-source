<p>When I first started using <a href="http://cryogenweb.org">Cryogen</a> to generate this website, I wanted to create a personalized theme. This desire led me to hack a the default theme into a mutant, which I boringly named &ldquo;<i>ryan1</i>&rdquo; (I anticipated it to be temporary). It looked like a relic, designed from when I first learned how to make a web page&hellip; the early 2000&rsquo;s. Like <del>many</del> all websites from that time, it was not mobile friendly. I hope to change all of that, by introducing my new website theme: <b><i>Immutable</i></b>.</p>

<em>Homepage with the old Theme</em></p>

<em>Homepage with the new Immutable Theme</em></p>

<p>While it may possibly still look dated (I wouldn&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m a backend dev), it addresses several of the issues I had with the <em>ryan1</em> theme. Here are a few examples of these improvements:</p>

<h3 id="removed-the-sidebar-dispersed-its-contents">Removed the Sidebar &amp; Dispersed Its Contents</h3>

<p><img src="../../img/posts/New-Theme-Immutable/sidebar-changes.png" width=100%>
<em>The sidebar components have been distributed to other parts of the site</em></p>

<p>I have to be honest here&hellip; I originally planned on keeping the side bar when I started to build the theme. I liked how it held all of my links (Github, LinkedIn, etc), recent posts, and tags in one, easy to find, location. I also liked having my avatar picture in the side bar. I felt it made the site more personable (or maybe I&rsquo;m just egotistical). After working on the base of the theme however, I realized the site might be better off without it. I&rsquo;ve relocated the items to other locations of the site. The majority of the links have been relocated to the drop-down menu (more on that  below), and I at least added my picture to the <a href="../../pages/about/">About Page</a>.</p>

<p>I might reinstate a sidebar in the future, but only if it looks <em>good</em> and I can add it <em>correctly</em>. The way I implemented the old sidebar caused many of the issues prompting this new theme, and I do not want to bring back those problems.</p>

<h3 id="removed-the-bad-footer">Removed the Bad Footer</h3>

<p><img src="../../img/posts/New-Theme-Immutable/ryan1-bad-footer.png" width=100%>
<em>Bad Footer Placements</em></p>

<p>One of the issues created by the sidebar and my poor css floats, was the footer. On pages with a large enough the main content, it looked fine, consisting of a dark gray bar <em>along the bottom of the page</em> . However, when viewing a page with a small content section, such as the <em>About</em> page, the footer would rise up behind the sidebar. It looked terrible.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/posts/New-Theme-Immutable/immutable-footer.png" width=100%>
<em>New Footer</em></p>

<p>In the <em>Immutable</em> theme, I have fixed the footer and removed the gray bar. The background looks great, and the text is clearly visible over it, making the bar no longer required. I like minimal footers. I only need a small copyright statement, and I enjoy having a <a href="http://cryogenweb.org">Cryogen</a> shout-out here. So that&rsquo;s all I have.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-support">Mobile Support</h3>

<p><img src="../../img/posts/New-Theme-Immutable/mobile-changes.png" width=100%>
<div id="caption">Mobile viewing the homepage and a post, on both the old theme and Immutable</div></p>

<p>The biggest reason for making the new theme was that viewing the website on a mobile device was a poor experience&hellip; unusable even. Again, because I implemented the sidebar poorly, it always remained on the side. Even on a narrow mobile screen. There was not enough room for the actual main content section, and pages/posts consisted of a skinny line of text down the side of the phone. Images&hellip; well, don&rsquo;t get me started on how well images were displayed. <em>Immutable</em> solves these issues. The main content window takes up the majority of the screen, allowing for easy content reading.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-navigation">Mobile Navigation</h3>

<p><img src="../../img/posts/New-Theme-Immutable/mobile-menu.png">
<div id="caption">Main navigation drop-down and the extended drop-down menu on mobile</div></p>

<p>In addition to better viewing, site navigation has also been improved on mobile. When I say <em>improved</em>, I of course mean <em>added</em>, as is was sort-of non-existent before. In <em>ryan1</em> there was an drop-down menu icon, but when it was tapped&hellip; nothing happened. At all. Now, there is an icon that drops down a site navigation menu when tapped. At the bottom of the navigation items, there is a <em>more</em> tab. When clicked, it extends the menu to also include my contact links (Github, LinkedIn, etc.), recent posts, and the list of post tag links.</p>

<h3 id="continued-work">Continued Work</h3>

<p>While its name is <em>immutable</em>, the actual theme itself is not (bad joke). There are a few things I plan on tweaking over time. For example, I don&rsquo;t love the fonts and spacing and I will continue to improve them. I also want to edit the <code>code</code> colors. I did a quick edit of the colors so that they worked with the theme, but they not what I ultimately want. I use the code segments a lot on this site, so it is important that they look nice.</p>

<p>Well, that is it. I finally got around to making a new theme, and plan to make it even better over time. I hope you enjoy, even on a phone ;).</p>
