I just want to document the steps I took to install my ubuntu VM to the HD I have in my dock. I will write this after I catch up on the LFS posts. Just want to template this out now since I spent the day working on it. (This also serves as a little log of what I've worked on. Kind of like how I posted the new desk pictures yesterday since I spent the day cleaning it up)
