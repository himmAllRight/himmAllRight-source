The last couple of weeks I have shifted back to using the i3 window mangers. When I first fired it up again, my fingers danced across the keyboard, remembering all of the personalized keybindings I have cultivated in my i3 configuration over the years. It is a simple, beautiful setup... except for one part. My i3status bar was looking rather blaned and dated, expecially comparted some of the i3 setups posted by all the cool kids over at [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). So, I decided it was time for a refreash.

When I first configured i3 seceral years ago, I used i3status because it was easy to setup with i3 and did what it needed by default. Over time, I learned how to create and modify [my own .i3status.conf](https://github.com/himmAllRight/dotfiles/blob/master/i3/.config/i3/i3status.conf) so that I could tweak it to play nice with my occasionaly unstandared configurations (ex: `/Data` partitions and such). While i3status served me well for many years, using the same-old setup has become boring. I started to notice several other really nice looking status bar tools being used in i3 setups, and wanted to try them out.

## Polybar
The first bar I saw and tried was [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar).
