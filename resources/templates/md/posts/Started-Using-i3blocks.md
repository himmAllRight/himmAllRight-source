The last couple of weeks I have shifted back to using the i3 window mangers. When I first fired it up again, my fingers danced across the keyboard, remembering all of the personalized keybindings I have cultivated in my i3 configuration over the years. It is a simple, beautiful setup... except for one part. My i3status bar was looking rather blaned and dated, expecially comparted some of the i3 setups posted by all the cool kids over at [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). So, I decided it was time for a refreash.
