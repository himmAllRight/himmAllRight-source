So after watching the Plasma 5 progress from a distance, I decided I
had to give it another try just before 5.6 was released.  Now right up
front I will admit I have never liked the KDE/Plasma desktop
environment (more on that below). But... I have been using using the Plasma desktop on all of my
personal computers for over a month (and haven't aborted yet...). Here
are my thoughts.

Now, I have
to say this right up front _I have never really liked KDE (now Plasma)_. In fact, some would say I've hated it every time I've used
it in the past. It is a great project, and I _desperatly want_ to like
it. I have tried again and again to have the project sweep me off my
feet, but it's design has always made me feel like I am using a
Fisher-Price operating system (which is ironic, because the plasma
desktop is probably one of the best power user environments out
there. The bulky themes always made it feel like toy). So, with that
said... I have been using using the Plasma desktop on all of my
personal computers for over a month (and haven't aborted yet...). Here
are my thoughts.
