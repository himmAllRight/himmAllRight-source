So after watching the Plasma 5 progress from a distance, I decided I
had to give it another try just before 5.6 was released.  Right up
front I will come clean and admit that I have never liked the
KDE/Plasma desktop environment (more on that below). But with that
said... I am still using the plasma desktop on my main computer
(months later, and haven't aborted yet...). Here are my thoughts.

### History
Now, as I have said above, _I have
never really liked KDE (now Plasma)_. In fact, I would say I've
hated it every time I've used it in the past. It is a great project,
and I _desperatly want_ to like it. I have tried again and again to
have the project sweep me off my feet, but it's design has always made
me feel like I am using a Fisher-Price operating system (which is
ironic, because the plasma desktop is probably one of the best power
user environments out there. The bulky themes always made it feel like
toy). So, with that nsaid... I have been using using the Plasma
desktop on all of my personal computers for over a month (and haven't
aborted yet...). Here are my thoughts.


* Thoughts Broken down to Pros/Cons

### Pros
* Theming really coming a long. No longer looks like a child's toy
* Love the customizability
* Lets me hide window bars
* Lets me create an awesome-wm environment, but as a full DE
* I love krunner. Like... a lot.
* Being able to do old-school animations is fun

### Cons
* Mult-monitor support. WTF.
* Randomly just stops working with things
* Sometimes all the settings can be very confusing (network?O

### Final Thoughts
* I can finally use Plasma
* Still has a bit of stability/polish work to go
* I'm still using it....so that's good.
