So after watching the Plasma 5 desktop environment progress from a
distance, I decided I had to give it another try.It was just before
5.6 was released, and the project seemed to really be finding it's
stride.  Now, right up front I want to come clean and admit that I have never
liked the KDE/Plasma desktop environment. But,
with that said... I am still using the plasma desktop on my main
computer (months later, and haven't aborted yet...). Here are my
thoughts.

### My History with KDE/Plasma Now, as I have said above, _I have
never really liked KDE (now Plasma)_. In fact, I would say I've hated
it every time I used it in the past. It is a great project, and I
_desperatly want_ to like it. It has so many features and is amazing
for power users. I have tried again and again to have the project
sweep me off my feet, but it's design has always made me feel like I
am using a Fisher-Price operating system (which is ironic, because
like I said... the plasma desktop is probably one of the best power
user environments out there). The bulky themes always made it feel
like toy. So, with that said... I have been using using the Plasma
desktop on all of my personal computers for over a few months. (and
haven't aborted yet...). Here are my thoughts.

### Pros
* **The theming has come a long way**. It no longer looks like a child's toy. Even the default theme is _very_ appealing.

* **I Love the customizability.** I love the level of customization
  the plasma desktop allows. I can set transparency, add/remove
  palnnels or widgets, set custom keybindings (very imprtant to me),
  and a bunch of other operations very easily.

-- add image of plasma options? --

* **Lets me hide window bars** One of these customizations that I love
  is the ability to hide the window bars. I am not a fan of window
  bars because I think they look clunky and just take up space. One
  aspect that I often like about tiling window managers is it is
  usually very easy to hide these window bars. This isn't always the
  case in Desktop Environments, but I was pleased to easily figure out
  how to do it in Plasma.

* **Lets me create an awesome-wm environment, but as a full DE**
  Similar to above, I am able to do some of the features I like about
  tiling window managers like awesome and i3, but with the full
  desktop environment. In addition to removing window bars, I like to
  eaisly move and resize windows by hitting the meta or alt key and
  left/right clicking the windows. Again, in Plasma this was simple.
* **I love krunner. Like... a lot.** I using like application
  launchers, and krunner looks nice, is fast, and gets the job done. I
  didn't realy know much about krunner during previous attempts at
  using KDE. This deffenitaly helped contribute to why I liked it much
  more this time around.

* **Being able to do old-school animations is fun** Not much to say
  here. While not very practicle, sometimes spinning a desktop cube is
  just plain _fun_.

* **Fast. Even for a full DE**

### Cons
* **Mult-monitor support. WTF.** This was by far the biggest issue I
  had. My main computer is a 17" laptop that I connect to two 24"
  displays. However, because it is a latop, I like that I can move it
  around and be semi-mobil with it. This requires disconnecting the
  monitors and going from 1 screen to 3 or vice-versa. Well it turns
  out that this is a pain in the ass in Plasma. First, I have to
  congigure the monitors 1 by on hitting "apply" between each
  configuration (it doesn't really like when I try to move and place
  all 3 displays in one swoop). Second, once I get how things should
  be, the pannels often go crazy and can't be found, or I have to play
  with them to set them up correctly. Lastly, sometimes the displays
  overlap each other oddly, even though they apprear normal in the
  display settings. The wallpapers almost never set correctly and my
  right-click menu is disabled on some screens but not
  others. Basically, it's just a hot mess and the most infuriating
  problem I faced when using Plasma. If I used a laptop without
  monitors, I would be fine.

* **Randomly just stops working with things** Sometimes, KDE
  applications just crash and I can't seem to get them back. Widgets
  seemed to beak things more frequently, so I just stopped using them.
* **A full DE** While I said above that it was nice having an
  environment that resembled a window manager, but had the benefit of
  having the full suite of applications that come with a desktop
  environment, sometimes it was also a pain. There's just a lot of
  crap that I don't use. The obvious remindiner of this was when I
  would run `pacman -Syu`, and see that the massive KDE stack would
  need updates.
* **Sometimes all the settings can be very confusing** Having all
  these options is great, but sometimes it was
  overwhelming. Additionally, the settings felt disjointed and I
  didn't know where the settings for some things where.

### Final Thoughts
* I can finally use Plasma
* Still has a bit of stability/polish work to go
* I'm still using it....so that's good. **


** <i>Update: I took forever to get this post out and I have actually
moved off of Plasma. I just couldn't handle the multi-monitor issues I
had. However, I will deffinetly be trying out the Desktop Environment
again in the future (I moved to i3-gaps for now. I love my tiling
window managers :) )</i>
