I swapped the HD in my laptop and have started to mess with it on actual hardware. One thing to note is that mounting the .iso to the usb didn't work, but taking the actual usb image they have (.fs) did. 

I tried installing gnome, but I'm having issues getting it to startup, but that's mostly because I need to read the docs :)
