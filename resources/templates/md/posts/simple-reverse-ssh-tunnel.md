This past week, I was on vacation with my family. While I didn't work a *ton* on personal projects, I was able to start up work on my [TunelBeacon](https://github.com/himmAllRight/TunnelBeacon) project again. I will write a full post about that project when I am further along. But basically, it will be a simple GUI to create reverse ssh tunnels, that I can have family and friends startup to provide me support access when they need help. Reverse SSH tunnels are *very* usefull and simple to setup, but can be a bit tricky to figure out at first. So, here's a breif and simple guide on how to easily create reverse tunnels.
