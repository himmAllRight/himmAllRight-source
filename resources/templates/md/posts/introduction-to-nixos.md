If someone were to ask my what my top three interests in computing right now I think I would say (in no particular order): 1) Functional Programming and Languages 2) Linux Operating Systems and related technology, and lastly, 3) Large distributed computing systems (with an specific interest in build systems)

So, is there a project out there that contains bits of all three of my computing interests? Yes there is. And it is called [NixOS](https://nixos.org).

I have followed NixOS for a few years now, playing with it off and on. I even had it installed as the main OS on my netbook for awhile. Recently, I have gotten the urge to once again scratch that itch... This time by seeing if I can install it on my main laptop, Alakazam.

### The Nix package manager
Before diving into NixOS, it is probably a good idea to first take some time and explain the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix).

### What is NixOS?

### Why use a Declarative Functional Operating System?

### Installing NixOS

### Setting up my configuration.nix file

### Installing Packages

### Rebuilding the configuration
