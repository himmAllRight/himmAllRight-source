This is just a simple update that I have completed the remainder of Chapter five. Despite how much later this is being posted from [my last LFS post](../LFS-SBUs-and-Binutils/), the remainder of the chapter was rather easy and uneventful. Just like this post.

I finished the compiling steps about a day or so after that post, and have taken a break from the project since then in order to create the new [site theme](../New-Theme-Immutable), and to setup a better [backup solution] for my server.

### Chapter 5 Compiling Summary

### Stripping

### Changing Ownership

### Next Steps



I have finished all the compilation steps for chapter 5, so I will write this post to summarize it, as well as explain the "Stripping" and "Changing Ownership" short sections. Should finally be a shorter post.
