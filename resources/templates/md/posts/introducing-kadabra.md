As I start to do more with a computer on the go, the netbooks I was
using just weren't cutting it anymore. They were great for minimal
use, but over-heated, couldn't run VMs, and didn't even have great
battery life. Now that I am starting to go to the library daily to
work through personal and open source projects, I really needed a better
mobile pc setup.

### Considerations 

I've been keeping an eye open for a new mobile computer for over a
year now. I mostly looked sub $300 ubuntu laptops like the Asus 11"
celeron I got in college. I determined that I didn't need much HD
space on my portable computer, because I usually only have a minimal
OS, my projects (which are git controlled), and sometimes a _little
bit_ of music. Even with dropping my requirements to computers with
_very tiny_ HDs (often < 60GB), none of the options seemed great. They
usually had Celeron processors, and little ram. Even worse, they
weren't easily expandable. I also briefly entertained the idea of
putting Linux on a chrombook, but they had the same issues that all
the other sub $300 options had.

### Used Thinkpads

When I started amp up my search, I started to consider other
options. One of these alternatives is very popular among Linux users,
but I always seem to forget about it when looking for a new
device. This option of course is buying a used Thinkpad and installing
Linux on it. This seemed like a great time to try this option out. I
don't mind if there is a scratch or two on the device. This is my
portable computer after all, so I'm sure a new device wouldn't stay
pristine for long anyway. So, I started researching used Thinkpads and
loved how much you got for your money. I could get i5 devices with a
good bit of ram and okay hard drives for under that $300 price
point. Better yet, it seemed super easy to upgrade all of the models I
looked at. So, even if the device had a bad battery, or needed a
RAM/HD upgrade, I _could could do it_. 

I eventually narrowed my search down to the X230 or T430s. That year's
model seemed like the perfect mix of still being relatively new, but
still being old enough that many business had started to replace
them, flooding the used market and driving the cost down. They also
didn't have the terrible track pad that the x240 and T440s had. I
eventually decided on the x230 because the main drive to get this
laptop was that I needed a new  portable computer.

### This Thinkpad x230 

I found my used x230 on Amazon, for about $185. It seemed to be in
okay shape in the pictures, and the specs were good for the price:
- Intel i5-3320M
- 4 GB RAM
- 12.5" 1366x768 HD LED Display
- HHD

It also listed that it came with a "used 6-cell battery". So I planned
from the beginning to have it replaced. Sure enough, the battery was
completely dead when I got the laptop. If I unplugged it, it
shutdown. So, I ordered a 9-cell battery online to replace it. I added
a 4GB RAM stick I took from an older laptop, and replaced the slow HHD
(with Windows pre-installed), with a cheap 120GB SSD I had lying
around. After installing Korora 24 on the new SSD, I suddenly had a
nice, portable computer that only cost me about $200 (plus some spare
parts). As advertised, swapping the battery, adding RAM, and replacing
the HD were _super simple_ and _accessible_.

### What I like about it
- **Track point** - I love track points. Using other laptops with
  trackpads is really frusterating now. I completly understand now why
  people are so crazy about them.
- **Keyboard** - They keyboard really is great. I feels solid and not like
  other laptop keyboards. It is very nice to type on. I know many
  people hate this model because they changed the keyboard from the
  older models like the x220, but I still think the x230 has a great
  keyboard.
- **Physical buttons** - The x230 has physical mute, volume control, and
  mic buttons. This is a feature I enjoy much more than I thought I
  would.
- **Upgradability**
- **Feel**
- **Bang for your buck**
- **Size**

### What I don't like
- **Has a little bit of flex**
- **Resolution**
- **Track pad (but honestly who cares)**
- **Wifi?**
- **Speakers aren't great (but again, not a bit deal)**

### Conclusions
I have had it for months now. I use it at work daily.
