When I first started using [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org) to generate this website, I wanted to create a personalized theme. This desire led me to hack a the default theme into a mutant, which I boringly named "<i>ryan1</i>" (I anticipated it to be temporary). It looked like a relic, designed from when I first learned how to make a web page... the early 2000's. Like ~~many~~ all websites from that time, it was not mobile friendly. I hope to change all of that, by introducing my new website theme: <b><i>Immutable</i></b>.

While it may possibly still look dated (I wouldn't know, I'm a backend dev), it addresses several of the issues I had with the *ryan1* theme. Here are a few examples of these improvements:

### Removed the Sidebar & Dispersed Its Contents

<div id="caption">The sidebar components have been distributed to other parts of the site</div>

I have to be honest here... I originally planned on keeping the side bar when I started to build the theme. I liked how it held all of my links (Github, LinkedIn, etc), recent posts, and tags in one, easy to find, location. I also liked having my avatar picture in the side bar. I felt it made the site more personable (or maybe I'm just egotistical). After working on the base of the theme however, I realized the site might be better off without it. I've relocated the items to other locations of the site. The majority of the links have been relocated to the drop-down menu (more on that  below), and I at least added my picture to the [About Page](../../pages/about/). 

I might reinstate a sidebar in the future, but only if it looks *good* and I can add it *correctly*. The way I implemented the old sidebar caused many of the issues prompting this new theme, and I do not want to bring back those problems.

### Removed the Bad Footer

One of the issues created by the sidebar and my poor css floats, was the footer. On pages with a large enough the main content, it looked fine, consisting of a dark gray bar *along the bottom of the page* . However, when viewing a page with a small content section, such as the *About* page, the footer would rise up behind the sidebar. It looked terrible.

In the *Immutable* theme, I have fixed the footer and removed the gray bar. The background looks great, and the text is clearly visible over it, making the bar no longer required. I like minimal footers. I only need a small copyright statement, and I enjoy having a [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org) shout-out here. So that's all I have.

### Mobile Support

The biggest reason for making the new theme was that viewing the website on a mobile device was a poor experience... unusable even. Again, because I implemented the sidebar poorly, it always remained on the side. Even on a narrow mobile screen. There was not enough room for the actual main content section, and pages/posts consisted of a skinny line of text down the side of the phone. Images... well, don't get me started on how well images were displayed. *Immutable* solves these issues. The main content window takes up the majority of the screen, allowing for easy content reading. 

### Mobile Navigation

<div id="caption">Main navigation drop-down and the extended drop-down menu on mobile</div>

In addition to better viewing, site navigation has also been improved on mobile. When I say *improved*, I of course mean *added*, as is was sort-of non-existent before. In *ryan1* there was an drop-down menu icon, but when it was tapped... nothing happened. At all. Now, there is an icon that drops down a site navigation menu when tapped. At the bottom of the navigation items, there is a *more* tab. When clicked, it extends the menu to also include my contact links (Github, LinkedIn, etc.), recent posts, and the list of post tag links.

### Continued Work
While its name is *immutable*, the actual theme itself is not (bad joke). There are a few things I plan on tweaking over time. For example, I don't love the fonts and spacing and I will continue to improve them. I also want to edit the `code` colors. I did a quick edit of the colors so that they worked with the theme, but they not what I ultimately want. I use the code segments a lot on this site, so it is important that they look nice.

Well, that is it. I finally got around to making a new theme, and plan to make it even better over time. I hope you enjoy, even on a phone ;).
