So I finally upgraded my phone. I have been using my HTC One M7 since my Junior or Senior year of College (s0 ~ 4-5 years ago). What can I say, I'm not a huge phone snob, and as far as tech goes, it's the last thing on my upgrade list. I know that Android devices, especially old out of date ones like mine, tend to be huge security vunerabilities. Phone manufacturors/vendors fail to push out security updates, and the phones quickly fall behind making them easy to exploit. So, with that in mind, when I started looking for a new phone, I started searching for one that would be my best shot at having a patched & secure android device, likely for a few years to come. That search led me oddly enough to ... Blackberry. Yep. You heard right.
