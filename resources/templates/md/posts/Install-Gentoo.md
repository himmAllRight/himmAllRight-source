Recently I have been itching to use a power-user distribution again. I want something I configure from the ground up and learn from. Yes, I was installing [Linux From Scratch ](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/tags-output/LFS), but took a break because I was getting bored and mostly just copy/pasting the commands. I want to learn from a system that I can jump into and use, and tinker with as I work. In the past, I have learn a lot from [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), and while there is still more to learn from it, I am very comfortable in Arch (I'd consider it my go-to power distro). I want something different, that I've failed at before. So, I installed Gentoo.
