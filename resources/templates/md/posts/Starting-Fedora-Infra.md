Recently I've been trying to figure out ways to gain some linux system
administration experience, which is hard to do on my own. So, I've turned to
open source. There is an endless amount of projects and ways to contribute to
them. However, while I can easily find ways to contribute code, it can be harder
to find administration type tasks to work on. This is why I love
the [Fedora Project](https://fedoraproject.org). They make it *real* easy
to [get involved](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join), and break down the
project into several groups, including.... the [infrastructure team](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure).

I have tried getting involved with the infrastructure group in the past, but
never really got anywhere. Admittedly, this had nothing to do with the project,
but rather my failure to reach out to the team members and get started. I think
it is about time I try again, hopefully getting further this time.

## Account Re-Setup

-- Spent some more time setting up for joining fedoraproject. I added the ssh
key from my VM on kadabra. I will figure out how to move that key to other
machines. 

## Work Environment Setup


## Starting Involvement

Also hung out in chatroom a little bit.

This morning I went through and finished most of the sign up stuff. I then asked
about the apprentice group in the IRC and someone helped me look for an issue to
work on. We
found [issue 6087](https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/6087) and I
commented that I would look into it. They did the first part and it needs to be
added to ansible, which I guess I will try to do. No one has replied.
Regardless, I also figured out where all the infrastructure notes were and
started to read through them to learn how everything is setup. 

This seems really cool and I think that if I am able to actually get involved
with this, I could learn a lot real fast. More importantly, I would finally
learn some of the stuff I need to if I want to do administration.
