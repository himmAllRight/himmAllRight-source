So I have been debating if I might switch back to fedora on my computers for a bit..

I have a few reasons which I will record here, and if I do decide to move along,
I will also plan out what I will do here. 

Main reasons are it just might make sense for what I am trying to do on my
computers these days. Solus is great for our standard desktop user or even Dev.
I'm reall not full using that workflow right now though. The main things I've
been doing are:

- Writting
- Running VMs
- Trying Server stuff
  - ZFS
  - KVM
  - ETC
- Trying to get involve with Fedora for Sysadmin experience

Solus is a great desktop OS, but I am trying to get more experience with server
type distros... which makes me think working in a Fedora environment and using
that to build up to also switching my Server to CentOS might be a better deal
for me... for now.

The main issue is that I still do want to be a part of the Solus community and
Dev there...

Maybe I could switch Alakazam to Fedora, and keep Kadabra on Solus, with the
Fedora dev VM?

IDK... I have to see. Also need to get remote Virt-manager working....


I'll think about all of this...
