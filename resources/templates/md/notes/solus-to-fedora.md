So I have been debating if I might switch back to fedora on my computers for a bit..

I have a few reasons which I will record here, and if I do decide to move along,
I will also plan out what I will do here. 


### Why Switch
Main reasons are it just might make sense for what I am trying to do on my
computers these days. Solus is great for our standard desktop user or even Dev.
I'm reall not full using that workflow right now though. The main things I've
been doing are:

- Writting
- Running VMs
- Trying Server stuff
  - ZFS
  - KVM
  - ETC
- Trying to get involve with Fedora for Sysadmin experience

#### Solus is still great
Solus is a great desktop OS, but I am trying to get more experience with server
type distros... which makes me think working in a Fedora environment and using
that to build up to also switching my Server to CentOS might be a better deal
for me... for now.

The main issue is that I still do want to be a part of the Solus community and
Dev there...

Maybe I could switch Alakazam to Fedora, and keep Kadabra on Solus, with the
Fedora dev VM?

IDK... I have to see. Also need to get remote Virt-manager working....


I'll think about all of this...

### The Switch
Well... I did it. I switched to Fedora on Alakazam yesterday. I went with the Fedora 25 KDE spin
and did all of the hoops to get that up and going. Not only am I getting used to Fedora gain, but
I am also finding myself having to get used to the KDE environment again... it does seem different
that other Plasma setups I've used in the past...

I am actually writting this ssh'd into Alakazam from Kadabra because it has none of it's apps...
because I am actually in a live environment of the Fedora 25 KDE spin here as well. I am doing it on
my test SSD, but will likely switch over to my perminent drive soon. I wanted to leave Solus on it,
but the network stuff kept dropping after suspend, as in it didn't even display available wireless
connections. Not good.

The update is done so I'm going to restart and get this running.

Alakazam is doing well on Fedora. I've been enjoying it a bit and think I might
stay on it. I am not sure about Kadabra's fate though. I am pretty sure that the
wifi stuff is due to Intel. Also, I've been experimenting with nixos again... so there's that...


### Update
So I am about to do my first Kernel update since being on Fedora again (on
Alakazam). We'll see how the video drives stuff is... To note, I am still on 25
so it hopefully won't be too bad...

No issues whatsover :)
