So I was origonally thinking about selling my TS440 to my parents for their nas,
but I think now I may keep that, and see if I can find a nice HP microserver gen
8 for them to get.... It's small, will make a great nas, and has 4 drive bays in
the front.

Now however, I have been thinking I will get a HP MicroCenter Gen8. I am keeping
my TS440 because I can't really have a rack at this time.
