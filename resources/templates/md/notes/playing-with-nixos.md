So in my quest to get wifi working on Kadabra, I started playing with nixos again...


This time I have future potential sights in mind... Apparently nixos runs great with zfs on linux...

So, I have currently setup a VM and am trying to get a good base
nixos-configuration started. Once I have that all nice, I think I might try
running it on Kadabra. There, I want to try out some server functionality and
see how that works. For example, I want to set it up to run kvm/qemu, lxc
containers, and test out how it handles zfs data pools. If all works well, it
might be a contender for my proxmox replacement I want to do. If not, Centos7
(or even Debian) are my fallbacks.

Nixos would be cool though....


Welp... I installed it on Kadabra. Working my way though this...
