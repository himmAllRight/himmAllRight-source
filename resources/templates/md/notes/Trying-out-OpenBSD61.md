I swapped the HD in my laptop and have started to mess with it on actual hardware. One thing to note is that mounting the .iso to the usb didn't work, but taking the actual usb image they have (.fs) did. 

I tried installing gnome, but I'm having issues getting it to startup, but that's mostly because I need to read the docs :)

After struggeling a bitto get everything working, I setup TrueOS to play with instead. I like the idea of a Workstation OS on my laptop with ZFS. It installed just fine, but I was having troubble with the wifi, and the suspend and everything ,and I just really didn't want to tinker with it anymore. 

I think I am going to put the BSD on metal hardware on pause until I get through a good bit of Absolute OpenBSD first.
