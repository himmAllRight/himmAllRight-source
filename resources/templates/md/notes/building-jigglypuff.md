Notes from configuring `Jigglypuff`, my container to host a [subsonic server](http://www.subsonic.org).

- Created container in proxmox
- Logged in as `root`
- Configured openssh-server
- Having network issues. Wonder if it's the container or our shitty router. I'm thinking router. Internal ip all works, but it cannot ping outside.


## Update
- I am actually going to use `libresonic`, the open source fork of it.
- Building a new Ubuntu 16.04 Container.
  - Having issues sshing into it
