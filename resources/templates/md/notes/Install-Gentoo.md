Recently I have been itching to use a power-user distribution again. I want something I configure from the ground up and learn from. Yes, I was installing [Linux From Scratch ](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/tags-output/LFS), but took a break because I was getting bored and mostly just copy/pasting the commands. I want to learn from a system that I can jump into and use, and tinker with as I work. In the past, I have learn a lot from [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), and while there is still more to learn from it, I am very comfortable in Arch (I'd consider it my go-to power distro). I want something different, that I've failed at before. So, I installed Gentoo.

## Notes for Post
* Installed in VM (For now, just testing)
* Trying to install with Systemd (it's what I know, and want to continue to learn)
* Starting out with a KDE/Plasma System base

#### Notes on Install
* Updating @world takes forever.
* Used several documentation pages when compiling kernel (not directly clear what to do with the systemd stuff).

* Virtual manger kept fucken pausing the vm so IDK wtf.


Retrying but this time I think I am just going to try to do a standard Plasma5
openrc install. I can learn more about Gentoo and then switch to doing an
install with systemd, once I know more about navigating the landsape.


Got the openrc version installed.... but the networking isn't working. Otherwise
looks good....
