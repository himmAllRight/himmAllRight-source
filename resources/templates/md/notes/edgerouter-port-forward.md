I setup port forwarding for a port to connect to ssh before leaving for
vacation. I sould document the process on how I did it on my edge router setup.
It was very easy, if I remember... another reason to document it. So, I have to
lookup some information to remember what I did, and to also check that what I
did wasn't completely stupid.

But this should be a nice quick post, but one I can eaily refer to in the
future.
