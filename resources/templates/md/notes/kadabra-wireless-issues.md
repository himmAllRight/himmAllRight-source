So, I have been fighting with wireless issues in Kadabra for a couple
of days now. It isn't just that the wireless keeps disconnecting
(indicating something is wrong with the wireless network, which is
quite possible considering that it is all new...). The wireless will
sometimes work on a new boot, but then it disconnects, and when it
does it seems that the whole wireless stuff disconnects. I cannot find
other networks, and ~nmcli~ returns that it is "unavailable".

- Started in Solus. One of the reasons I also installed Fedora on
  Kadabra (I was going to leave Solus on it for a bit more).

- Still experiencing it in Fedora KDE

- Tried installing wireless drivers but I don't think they were the
  right ones.

- Trying to install the ~@gnome-desktop~ stuff, in case this all has
  to do with some sort of kd3/qt networkmanager stuff? (which could of
  been happening in Solus these days... not sure)


I am really hoping this isn't a hardware issue...
