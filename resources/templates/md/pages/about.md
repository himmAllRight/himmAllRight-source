I am a 25 year-old back-end software developer working in Walpole MA, at a company that primarily develops in [Allegro Common Lisp](http://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/). I spend most of my days writing LISP code, so naturally, I am also a big fan of [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and spend my working hours with it full screen (which also helps me forget I'm in Windows). 

Outside of work, I am an avid Linux user that loves learning about
programming (especially functional languages), computers, and open source technologies. While I majored in Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/), I am largely a self-taught learner and continue to study computer science and IT topics by working on on [personal projects](https://github.com/himmAllRight?tab=repositories) and maintaining my [homelab](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/pages/homelab/). This website is mostly to help document these personal projects I work on.

Beyond technology, I love music, reading, hiking, and swimming (I competitively swam through college). I am married to an amazing third year Medical Student at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. We have been together for over 10 years and [got married](http://wedding.himmelwright.net) on September 17th, 2016 (the day before our 10th anniversary).
