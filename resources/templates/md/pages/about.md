I am a 25 year-old back-end software developer working in Walpole MA,
at a company that primarily develops in [Allegro Common Lisp](http://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/). I spend
most of my days writing LISP code, so naturally I am also a big fan
of [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and work with it full screen.

Outside of work, I am an avid Linux user and love learning about
computers and open source technologies. I majored in
Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/). I am largely a self-taught learner and continue to study computer
science and IT topics by working on on [personal projects](https://github.com/himmAllRight?tab=repositories), my [homelab](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/pages/homelab/), and training to earn certificates like the [RHCSA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa).

Outside of technology, I love music, reading, hiking, and swimming (I competitively
swam through college).  I have a fiancee named Rebecca who is a second
year Medical Student at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown
University. We have been together for over 9 years and will be
[getting married](http://wedding.himmelwright.net) September 17th, 2016 (the day before our 10th anniversary).
