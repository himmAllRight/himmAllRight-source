I am a 24 year-old backend software developer working in Walpole, MA
at a company that primarily develops in [Allegro Common Lisp](http://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/). I spend
most of my days writting LISP code, so naturally I am also a big fan
of [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and work with it fullscreen.

Outside of work, I am an avid Linux user and love learning about
computers and open source technologies. While I majored in
Neuroscience at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/), I continue to learn about computer
science by working on my [homelab](homelab.md), and by working towards my Masters
degree in Computer Science at the [University of Massachuesetts -
Boston](https://www.umb.edu/).

Outside of technology, I love to read, hike, and swim (I competitively
swam through college). I have a fiancee named Rebecca who is a second
year Medical Student at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown
University. We have been together for over 9 years and will be
[getting married](http://wedding.himmelwright.net) September 17th, 2016 (the day before our 10th anniversary).

I guess that is enough for a summary. If you would like more, feel
