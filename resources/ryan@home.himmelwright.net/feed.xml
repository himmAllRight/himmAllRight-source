Back On Arch, After Frantic Distro-hopping
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, I have started my CS masters classes, and needed to setup a productive work environment on my portable laptop (&lt;a href='../../homelab'&gt;abra&lt;/a&gt;). Also, while I love Fedora, the Nvidia stuff was being a pain on my main computer (&lt;a href='../../homelab'&gt;alakazam&lt;/a&gt;), and I was looking for a replacement there as well. So, after a long, drawn out battle trying nearly all of my favorite Linux distros, I have found myself once again using &lt;a href='https://www.archlinux.org/'&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; on both of my personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash;more&amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;from&amp;#95;fedora...&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From Fedora...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/fedora-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fedora&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started my journey, I had Fedora on both of my computers. I really like the &lt;a href='https://www.getfedora.org'&gt;Fedora Project&lt;/a&gt; and I think Fedora is a great distribution with a lot of innovative new features. I seems that the Fedora Project is aiming to be the Linux Distro for developers, and I feel that they are really starting to hit that target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one remaining big issue I had while running Fedora on my main computer. Nvidia drivers. They are just a pain to maintain, and kept breaking my system during updates. I know the &lt;a href='http://rpmfusion.org/'&gt;RPM Fusion Repos&lt;/a&gt; are supposed to help, but they just aren't there yet. With my classes starting, I needed something that was a bit more stable (and would hopefully support installing VMWare Workstation 9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;the&amp;#95;'easy&amp;#95;stability'&amp;#95;of&amp;#95;ubuntu-based?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The 'Easy Stability' of Ubuntu-based?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/ubuntu-mate-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu Mate&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided by desires to have a &quot;stable&quot; distro, I decided that the &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; answer would be to use an &lt;a href='http://www.ubuntu.com/'&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;-based distro. So, I went with &lt;a href='https://ubuntu-mate.org/'&gt;Ubuntu Mate&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt; work the team has done recently. I've used Ubuntu Mate in the past on several different computers, and in fact, still have it running on &lt;a href='../../homelab/'&gt;charmander&lt;/a&gt;. I had some issues installing Ubuntu Mate on alakazam for some reason, but using a simple &lt;code&gt;nomodeset&lt;/code&gt; at boot seemed work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I got it installed, I was able to install the nvidia drivers, but I had other random issues here and there. I also tried installing VMWare, but had issues at every step. To be completely honest, I really wasn't feeling using an Ubuntu distro on alakazam. If I was going to be replacing Fedora, I wanted to make up for it by using something that gave me more power (I've started to get the itch to try out Gentoo again. Spoiler, I am not using Gentoo. At least until my class is over...). While Ubuntu could easily support my needs being the well supported and advanced distro that it is ... I craved something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;leaping&amp;#95;to&amp;#95;suse?&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Leaping to Suse?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/opensuse-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenSuse Linux&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my last few months on Fedora, I took notice of another rpm distro that was  making noise in the Linux community: &lt;a href='https://www.opensuse.org/'&gt;OpenSuse&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the new &lt;a href='https://software.opensuse.org/421/en'&gt;OpenSuse Leap&lt;/a&gt; piqued my interest. I had played with it in a VM a few days earlier and liked what I saw. The OpenSuse installer along with the YaST configuration tool makes it &lt;i&gt;stupid easy&lt;/i&gt; to setup powerful and advanced features in Linux. Want to setup a KVM virtualization environment or a samba share? You basically just have to click a button. Testing out &lt;a href='https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Snapper'&gt;Snapper&lt;/a&gt; was also slick. I wish more distributions would start to include tools like snapper, built in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leap was a solid and extensive distribution. Ultimately though, that was the biggest qualm I had with it: there was a lot going on. I did not know what many of the pre-installed configuration tools were. Normally, I am fine with learning new tools, but I wanted a distribution that I could set up and get to work. OpenSuse had &lt;i&gt;too many&lt;/i&gt; &quot;toys&quot; already in it. I would not be able to resist spending hours learning everything. Ironically, my other complaint was that some of the applications I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; want, were not easily available. Often, they were not included in the default repositories, and while many application websites will provide a &lt;em&gt;.deb download, &lt;/em&gt;.rpms are a bit more scarce. I know there is the wonderful &lt;a href='https://build.opensuse.org/'&gt;openSuse Build Service&lt;/a&gt;, but like &lt;a href='https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/'&gt;Fedora's copr build system&lt;/a&gt;, I often found it to be hit or miss. Both do a good job at addressing a major issue in their respective distributions, but neither isn't quite to the level of ... well, the &lt;a href='https://aur.archlinux.org/'&gt;AUR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;antegeros&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Antegeros&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/antergos-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Antegeros Linux&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to &lt;a href='https://antergos.com/'&gt;Antergos&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, I was no longer able to hide the fact that I was starting to severely miss many features a distribution like &lt;a href='https://www.archlinux.org/'&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; provides. I love that you can easily customize just about &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;. I also appreciate that if I want to try something new, 99% of the time the latest version is already in the official repos or the &lt;a href='https://aur.archlinux.org/'&gt;AUR&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, when I am trying a new application, or customizing my setup, the &lt;a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/'&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt; has some of &lt;i&gt;the best documentation&lt;/i&gt; in the Linux ecosystem. However, I wanted something that I could just install and have working. I didn't feel like going through a full vanilla Arch install. So I installed Antergos. Antergos has a simple but thorough installer that pulls down all the latest packages during the installation. This leaves the user with an up-to-date and &lt;i&gt;gorgeous&lt;/i&gt; setup after installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the &quot;simplicity&quot; of Antergos (which is sort of the antithesis to the definition of &lt;i&gt;simplicity&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;a href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Simplicity'&gt;The Arch Way&lt;/a&gt;) always seems to bite me in the end. Eventually, &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; breaks, and I have a hard time figuring out &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;. While it might be a pain to install &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; in vanilla Arch, the user &lt;i&gt;&quot;has a much fuller understanding of his or her system&lt;/i&gt;&quot; as a result. A few years ago, when I first started using Arch, I thought this argument just stupid gray beard nonsense. Now, I appreciate the benefits of this sentiment, and even agree with it (I've also learned to &lt;a href='https://github.com/himmAllRight/dotfiles/blob/master/archInstallScript.sh'&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; my post install process, so it is less of a pain :P).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few days of fighting with Antegeros, I decided to just bite the bullet and install Vanilla Arch. I still think Antegros is a great distribution that works for a bunch of people. It is great for users that want to experience the power of arch Linux, without having to go through all the overhead. Antegeros is actually how I started to learn Arch Linux. Nowadays though, I seem to prefer &lt;i&gt;simplicity&lt;/i&gt; of vanilla Arch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;all&amp;#95;roads&amp;#95;lead&amp;#95;to&amp;#95;arch&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All Roads Lead to Arch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/arch-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Arch Linux&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been running Arch on both of my personal laptops for several weeks now. Arch doesn't magically solve all of my issues, but it makes &lt;i&gt;fixing&lt;/i&gt; them much easier. If something isn't working, the combination of the wiki and the community make the problem &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more approachable. Additionally, the rolling release model appears to mitigate bug-related issues, instead of cause them. For example, I installed Arch on alakazam first, but left Ubuntu Mate on abra (my portable laptop). I did this because my school has a weird network setup that is often difficult to connect to. After searching for hours, I determined that my issues under Ubuntu were caused by a known, but unfixed, bug in my version of network manager. I did not feel like dealing with this, so I installed arch. My internet at school works works fine now. I was able to use the wiki to properly configure my settings, and I was good to go. (Side-note: I never fully got VMWare 9 to work properly on any of my distros, but I came closest with Arch.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/back-on-arch/abra-screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;Abra with Arch and Awesome WM&quot; /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Abra running Arch Linux with the &lt;a href='http://awesome.naquadah.org/'&gt;Awesome&lt;/a&gt; window manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being back on arch has been great. I love using tiling window managers like i3, dwm, xmonad, stumpwm, and awesome. While this this is possible on all distributions, it is much easier on arch. Starting with a blank slate, and (again) having the wiki makes setting up alternative desktop environments and window managers a breeze. I now have a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; productive work environment that is tailored to my needs. While Arch Linux might not be a traditional &quot;stable&quot; distribution, I have found it to be much more durable for my use-case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am planning to stay on Arch for awhile. That being said, I really did enjoy all the other distributions I tried out. Each one seems to be carving out a niche in the Linux environment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fedora is becoming a great distribution for Linux developers. In fact, I still have Fedora 23 (Server Edition) running on my home server. Assuming that the upgrade to 24 goes smoothly (my upgrade from 22 -&gt; 23 went great, thanks to &lt;a href='https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/DNF'&gt;dnf&lt;/a&gt;), I see no reason to switch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenSuse Leap is a solid distribution that is great for power users that want a turn-key distribution with all the bells and whistles. I think it is especially geared toward people with system administration backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Mate is really the best distribution out there for people that want a classic feeling Linux environment, with a modern flair. It is what Ubuntu would be if it never left gnome 2. It is also great for low resource hardware, particularly boards like the &lt;a href='https://www.raspberrypi.org/'&gt;raspberry pi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antegros is fantastic for Arch users that hate the Arch install. It is also great for people that want to move to Arch, but aren't yet comfortable with tools like pacman.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is great to see all the distributions finally finding their groove. This isn't something I could say about Linux 2 years ago. As I have already stated, I plan to stay on Arch Linux for the time being, but I am very excited to continue trying out the new releases of the all distributions listed above. With so many great options, it really is a great time to be a Linux user :) .&lt;/p&gt;

How I asked my Groomsmen
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months Rebecca (my Fiancee) and I have continued making progress on all the little tasks that we have to complete before our wedding. One of these tasks is asking our intended bridesmaids/groomsmen to be in the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&amp;ndash;more&amp;ndash;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca approached this by asking each of the girls in a way that was somewhat unique to each person, over time. Even though each person was asked differently, all the methods were executed in a very &quot;Rebecca-like&quot; manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I was told that I couldn't simply ask the guys. I had to figure out a &quot;fun&quot; way to ask them, and if possible, to do it in a way that was very &quot;Ryan-like&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;asking&amp;#95;the&amp;#95;groomsmen&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Asking the Groomsmen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Rebecca was slowly chipping away at asking her bridesmaids, we kept failing at finding a way to ask the guys. Finally, one night while driving back north to Massachusetts, I said out of frustration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;I wish I could just write a stupid piece of code that asks them,  compile it, and give it to them... wait a minute....&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I started to figure out how I could make it work. The results of that brainstorming session are described below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;snail&amp;#95;mail&amp;#95;part&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Snail Mail Part&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first had to find a way to give the intended groomsmen a link to get any code that I wrote. So, Rebecca and I designed the tri-fold letter pictured below (Sorry for the photo quality).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/how-i-asked-my-groomsmen/ask-message1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The front of the letter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: The Front of Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front of the envelope had a simple black boarder and said &quot;She said that I had to make it official.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/how-i-asked-my-groomsmen/ask-message2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The first flap of the letter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: The First Flap of the Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the reader flipped up that flap, another message read &quot;So we're doing this my way&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../img/posts/how-i-asked-my-groomsmen/ask-message-qr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The QR code posted inside the letter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: The QR Code posted on the Inside of the Letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, when the reader folded that flap down, they got a taste of what &quot;my way&quot; might entail when the only thing that was printed on the page was a single QR code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the reader scanned the QR code, it opened up a list of instructions on their phone that said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find your computer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href='&quot;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/message/&quot;'&gt;http://ryan.himmelwright.net/message/&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text Me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;website&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Website&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the intended groomsmen went to the link provided, they saw a webpage that I made, containing our wedding logo on the bottom right, and a welcome message. The welcome message basically stated that the webpage was not the end of the scavenger hunt, and that they would have to download some code that I compiled, that contained the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below the welcome message, I had separate instructions that guided Window, Mac, and Linux users, as well as users that wished to compile from source (sort of).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below that I had links to the executable downloads for each operating system mentioned. Lastly, I posted the source code for the code they were downloading, because … you know… open source. Executable(s)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the intended groomsmen ran the compiled code (source code posted below), it showed them that it was &quot;decrypting&quot; their message, and printed the percent complete. After about 20% or so, I confessed that there was no &quot;decrypting&quot; and that each message is decoded when printed. I then proceeded to rant in these &quot;decrypting&quot; messages about how I originally wrote a nice GUI python app, but it was a pain to cross compile, and how I eventually just scrapped it and wrote it in LISP. I also mentioned that if they all ran Linux, it wouldn't of been an issue. When it finally reached 100%, I decided to finally give them the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source Code for the executable I wrote containing the message. Nothing fancy, but everything hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;;; Used to build the executable
&amp;#40;defun build-exe &amp;#40;exe-src&amp;#41;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Message&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After putting up with my ranting, I finally posted the message asking the guys to be my groomsmen. It read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, putting all jokes and nerdy-ness aside, I do have an important  question to ask. As you are probably aware, Rebecca and I are finally  getting married in September. This is will be a very special &lt;em&gt;DAY&lt;/em&gt; in  my life, and as a very special &lt;em&gt;PERSON&lt;/em&gt; in my life, I would like to  ask:  Will you be one of my groomsmen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2 days after we mailed out the letters, all of then intended groomsmen had messaged me back, confirming that they would be my groomsmen. I also think they enjoyed my methods of asking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I was successful in asking everyone in a very &quot;Ryan-like&quot; fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

25 Days of C
</title>
<description>
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;As I continue to learn more and more programming languages, I am somewhat ashamed to admit that I have yet to learn C. However, it is not because I am trying to avoid it.&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;the&amp;#95;reason&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Reason&lt;/h2&gt;C is one of the top languages I wish to know, and know well. C is the backbone for so much code, especially in the Linux ecosphere that it is almost imperative for one to at least understand it. I keep trying to poke my head into open source projects, and so many of them are built or based on C (especially when looking at projects more at the distro and distro applications level).&lt;p&gt;Also, this spring I will start working on my CS MS degree, and while I think the first course I take will be theory based, I know several other courses that will require it (ex: computer architecture and compilers). Being comfortable with C will allow me to focus on the topics, and not on the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have some experience with C++ from my software engineering course I took during undergrad, but that is about it. My goal however is to understand just plain C, which will hopefully make implementing other C-based languages such as C++ a bit easier. My ultimate goal is to eventually have C be one of my top 3 languages (I'm thinking LISP, C, and maybe python or ruby. I know. I'm old school.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;the&amp;#95;plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks, I have set up and started looking at &lt;a href='http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/'&gt;Learn C the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt;. I read the first section or two, but haven't been consistent with working through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that it is December, I thought I should maybe start a new monthly challenge, or even a &quot;12/25 days till something&quot;. I was thinking about things I've been trying to constantly work on the last few months, and C popped into my head. Learn C the Hard Way fits particularly well because it is broken down nicely into small segments that I can maybe commit to being able to finish 1 per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to look ahead a bit to see if this challenge is doable, but i think that as of now, the plan is to try to complete at least 1 (I can work ahead if I want to) segment of the book a day for the month of December. I am also going to allow myself the ability to &quot;pre-cache&quot; segments ahead of time so that I don't have to pull away and work on it during the holidays if I don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think this is a good plan that should allow me to start getting some C experience under my belt. I'll be sure to update in the future with how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, now that I have made it a good bit through the month, I must admit that I have not adhered to this challenge very strictly. I have done many of the exercises, but I have fallen somewhat behind. Basically, I accomplished a bunch of other things and let this challenge slide. I will continue to work on it, but I haven't been able to keep with with the one exercise per day rate. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
