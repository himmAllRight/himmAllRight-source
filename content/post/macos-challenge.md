Intro

### Why


Actually I wouldn't even consider this if I didn't already ssh into my desktop from any other device already (or in fact technically do that even ON my desktop these days since nearly everything is done in a container.

### The Challenge

>Using a mac as the interface device for my personal computing for 30 days.

Here, "interface computer" means the device that I sit at and interact with
it's GUI.
For example, I might be sitting at macOS and using it for my web browsing and
music, but working on a project on my linux workstation via a mosh/tmux session
in iTerm. I want to dig deep into this setup and see if it's something I should
think about switching to.

One thing to note is that I still used Desktop Linux as my "interfacing
computer" for work.

Currently, I am really only interesting in using macOS for
my personal computing. At home, I don't mind iOS and macOS teaming up to make
my "normal person" computing (web browsing, video chatting family, emails)
easier. Where I care about working on Linux is in the backend. So having the
front end get out of the way, and not tempt me with the ability to fine-tune
it, or even switch desktop environments completely, is a good thing for me
(currently).

At work on the other hand, I don't need my computer to by in step with my
personal phone and/or ipad. In fact, I like having that barrier there. Also,
Linux works REALLY well for the work I do, especially when it comes to running
VMs (I love `libvirt`). So, there currently isn't a reason (or even a desire)
to switch there.
