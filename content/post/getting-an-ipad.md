Over the last few months, I've been considering getting a tablet device for the
first time since my sophomore year of college. After extensive research, it
became clear that ipads are really the only competition in the tablet
space right now. After convincing myself that I'd likely pickup a 2018 9.7" iPad at some
point... I ordered an iPad Pro (2017 model). Here's why.

## Why a Tablet?
When I use technology, I try to figure out and use devices which best fit the
tasks I to do. Evaluating how I complete many tasks, I've started to think that
a tablet might work well for many of my use cases.

The main reason? I don't like using smartphones. While I think modern phones
are a wonderful piece of technology, they are often misused. The smartphone has
become most people's main computer (in that it's the one they use the most).
While I agree it can be the *best* device for *some* tasks, particularly ones
on the go, it isn't *great* at many other tasks people use them for.

So the main reason for adding a tablet to my list of devices, is to offload
some of what I use my phone for, to the tablet which is much better suited for
some of these activities.

#### Portable Media Consumption
Youtube, Hulu, Netflix
For example, many people (and
I started to notice myself included with this group) also love to watch videos,
read books, and browse the web from their phones. These are all activities that
run best on... a tablet. The key for *me*, is that these coincidentally are
all activities that I *don't really want to be doing on the go*. If anything,
they are a distraction.
