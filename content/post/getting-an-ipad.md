Over the last few months, I've been considering getting a tablet device for the
first time since my sophomore year of college. After extensive research, it
became clear that ipads are really the only competition in the tablet
space right now. After convincing myself that I'd likely pickup a 2018 9.7" iPad at some
point... I ordered an iPad Pro (2017 model). Here's why.

## Why a Tablet?
When I use technology, I try to figure out and use devices which best fit the
tasks I to do. Evaluating how I complete many tasks, I've started to think that
a tablet might work well for many of my use cases.

<a href="/img/posts/getting-an-ipad/keyone.png"><img alt="Blackberry KEYone" src="/img/posts/getting-an-ipad/keyone.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: left;"/></a>

The main reason? I don't like using smartphones. While I think modern phones
are a wonderful piece of technology, they are often misused. The smartphone has
become many user's  *main* computing device.  While I agree it can be the *best*
device for *some* tasks (particularly ones "on the go"), it isn't *great* at
the hundreds of other tasks which people use them for. In the worst case, many
apps are convenient distractions.

I try to keep the set of apps installed on my phone to a minimum, only using
the ones I deem to be best used on my phone. Over the past few months, I have
noticed myself starting to use my phone for many "computer/TV" activities when
I want to be more portable. The experience of these tasks on the phone isn't
great, and I realized they would be best completed on a tablet. Some of the
activities I intend to offload from my phone to my iPad are:


#### Portable Media Consumption

<a href="/img/posts/getting-an-ipad/youtube-logo.png"><img alt="Youtube Logo" src="/img/posts/getting-an-ipad/youtube-logo.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: right; margin: 15px 15px 15px 15px;"/></a>

I tend to watch most of my media on our TV or at my computer, but I did start
to notice myself watching Youtube, or shows on Hulu and Netflix from my phone
more often, when I wanted to watch from a different location, or if the TV was
in use. With a small screen and crap speakers, watching video on a phone is
terrible, especially on my [Blackberry
KEYone's](https://blackberrymobile.com/us/product/blackberry-keyone/) smaller
screen (Which I have to be a great *communication device* with a long
battery life. However, even on large bezel-less phone screens, watching video is
still terrible).

In college, I used my previous tablet ([an Asus Transformer
T101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_Pad_Transformer), with no dock) to
watch videos in my dorm or around campus. It was a great portable viewing
experience, and I assumed that with modern tablets, wit would only be better.

#### Reading

Being such a visual learner, I tend to gravitate towards visual media. Reading
however, is much less passive than video. When watching a video, it will
continue to progress whether the viewer is paying attention or now. Reading is
much more self-driven and I find it helps to build my concentration. So,
Reading is something I am always trying to do more of.

While I have had a kindle for years, and it is the best way to consume books
*for me*, there are other areas of my reading material it isn't great for. For
example, thanks to [Humble Book
Bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/) I have aquired a collection of
programming, DevOps, SysAdmin, and general tech books. You know, the type of book that is
*technically* classified as a "textbook"... but I refrain from calling it so.
Anyway the point is... they are terrible to read on the kindle. I sometimes
have them open on my monior, but that experience isn't great either. I'd really
like to have a way to flip through them. A tablet device lets me do that.

The internet is full of all sorts of "artciles". News artciles, blog
posts, product announcements, opinion pieces, tutorials, reviews, all litter
the internet. Recently, I've been starting to control this craziness by using
tools like [pocket](https://getpocket.com/) to *save* articles I want to read.
Then, I come back and batch-read them later. This helps me break the time suck
and digging through and semi-reading articles, half of which aren't even good.
This practice has been great so far, but I do think it would be ideal to be able
to sit down in an arm chair with a tablet in my lap during my batch reads.

#### Offload *Some* of My Smart Phone Use

Lastly, as stated above, my biggest motivations for buying a tablet are to
offload my phone use to it. For some apps, I want to offload my use of them
*entirely* to a tablet. This is largly for apps that I enjoy using, or *need*
to have... but don't need them with me all the time on my phone.

The best example of this? Banking and other financial apps. I appreciate the
ease of modern banking, and love that I can easily take a picture of a check to
deposit it. However, I don't need this on my phone. Not only am I unlikely to
be scanning checks and moving money around my bank accounts in public... it
isn't really safe and secure to be doing so. I'd rather just wait until I get
home to my own network, and do my banking from a tablet (which safely stays at
home/away more often than my phone).


## Why an iPad?

<a href="/img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipod-video.png"><img alt="Pocket Logo" src="/img/posts/getting-an-ipad/ipod-video.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: left; margin: 20px 20px 10px 10px;"/></a>
#### My Apple Device History


I originally wanted to do a full *multi-paragraph section* detailing my limited
use of apple products throughout my life, and how I only really buy them when
they obviously stand out. But that would be pretentious, extremely boring, and
quite honestly, annoying. So in short: The only Apple devices I have owned are
1) an iPod "Video", an iPod "Touch", and ... my wife has had Apple devices that
I've played with and helped occasionally fix??? So why am I willing to get an
iPad as my tablet device?




#### Other Options

When I started looking at tablets, I quickly noticed that the market has
changed *dramatically* from a few years ago. While there are still android
tablets available, the future of Google supporting android on tablets is a bit
unclear, as they appear to be trying to shift them to ChromeOS, as observed on
their own [Pixel
Slate](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_slate?hl=en-US) device.
Android still tends to treat tablets as just a large screen phone, and
applications are often not optimized for it. So I was a little leery about
Android tablets. As for ChromOS tablets, the Slate is currently the only real
contender, but with it's high price point, and [lack-luster
reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jsqZMCPJts), it was out of the running.

At the *extreme* low end of the tablet market, was the [Amazon Fire Tablet
Family](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-Tablet-Family/). While these devices
are very affordable, and would work for anyone that really just wants to
read/watch video on a tablet. However, desipite that being the main thing
discussed above, I do tend to push my technology to it's limit as I experiment
with it. I just felt that the Fire tablet limit might be too low for me.
Additionally, the very cheap versions of the tablet are the "with special
offers" ones, which basically show amazon ads (like a kindle) on the tablet. By
the time I had selected a 10" tablet *without* special offers, the price point
started approaching (note quite, but close enough to consider jumping up)
another contender... the 2018 iPad.
