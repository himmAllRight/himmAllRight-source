Over the last few months, I've been considering getting a tablet device for the
first time since my sophomore year of college. After extensive research, it
became clear that ipads are really the only competition in the tablet
space right now. After convincing myself that I'd likely pickup a 2018 9.7" iPad at some
point... I ordered an iPad Pro (2017 model). Here's why.

## Why a Tablet?
When I use technology, I try to figure out and use devices which best fit the
tasks I to do. Evaluating how I complete many tasks, I've started to think that
a tablet might work well for many of my use cases.

The main reason? I don't like using smartphones. While I think modern phones
are a wonderful piece of technology, they are often misused. The smartphone has
become many user's  *main* computing device.  While I agree it can be the *best*
device for *some* tasks (particularly ones "on the go"), it isn't *great* at
the hundreds of other tasks which people use them for. In the worst case, many
apps are convenient distractions.

I try to keep the set of apps installed on my phone to a minimum, only using
the ones I deem to be best used on my phone. Over the past few months, I have
noticed myself starting to use my phone for many "computer/TV" activities when
I want to be more portable. The experience of these tasks on the phone isn't
great, and I realized they would be best completed on a tablet. Some of the
activities I intend to offload from my phone to my iPad are:


#### Portable Media Consumption

I tend to watch most of my media on our TV or at my computer, but I did start
to notice myself watching Youtube, or shows on Hulu and Netflix from my phone
more often, when I wanted to watch from a different location, or if the TV was
in use. With a small screen and crap speakers, watching video on a phone is
terrible, especially on my [Blackberry
KEYone's](https://blackberrymobile.com/us/product/blackberry-keyone/) smaller
screen (Which I have to be a great *communication device* with a long
battery life. However, even on large bezel-less phone screens, watching video is
still terrible).

In college, I used my previous tablet ([an Asus Transformer
T101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_Pad_Transformer), with no dock) to
watch videos in my dorm or around campus. It was a great portable viewing
experience, and I assumed that with modern tablets, wit would only be better.

#### Reading

Humble Book Bundle, Paper, Kindle

#### "Touch" browsing

#### Offload *Some* of My Smart Phone Use
Banking Apps, Email Apps, Housing


## My Apple Device History

I was going to do a full section detailing my limited use of apple products
throughout my life, only buying them when they obviously stand out. But that
would be boring. So in short: The only Apple devices I have owned are 1) an
iPod "Video", an iPod "Touch", and ... my wife had an Macbook air I helped
occasionally fix??? So why be willing to get an iPad?
