## Old Card - RX560
### Why I got it
- Wanted an AMD Card
	- Open source drivers much better
	- Had issues with Nvidia on my Bonobo and work laptop with nvidia GPUs
	- I dont the the absolute best GPU performance

### Plans to eventually upgrade
- AMD cards were still just starting to come down in price from crypto miners
-
	- Possibly to the rx580

### Issues with RX560
- no displays when attached
- Computer worked fine to ssh in and my VMs always started up fine
- I wan't really able to re-install a distro if I had to (or most distros at least) without a display, and was worried something might break and I'd be stuck without my main VM host...

## The RX-580
- Capable of what I need it for
	- The 560 worked fine for me, but might of heated up a bit because it was startign to be pushed
	- The 580 should be able to handle all the games I play perfectly
- Prices have gone down a bit on it since I built Charmeleon
	- When I build it prices had just started to come down from the bitcoin mining
	- Plust it's an older card now
