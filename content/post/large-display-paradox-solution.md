About a year ago, I [switched to using LG's ud4379b, a single 42.5" 4k IPS
monitor](/post/new-lgud4379b/). My motivation to *switch* monitors was mostly
to convert to an IPS panel. My *selection of monitor* on the other hand, was an
attempt to simplify my hardware by only having a single monitor. I wanted a
single monitor, but not at the cost of loosing the 2x(1920x1080) resolution my
duel 1080p setup had, because [everyone knows]() [that multiple monitors]()
[are required]() [to get any real work]() [done,]() [especially programming]().
After a year of my large display with a massive resolution, I started to
feel the large  display paradox.
