### My Experience and Solution
- Out of my field of view
- Couldn't easily window manage
    - My new "maximize window" requirement
    - Still like to split when needed
    - 2560x1440 is great for this


#### Talk a bit about the research
- Number of Screens vs. Total Resolution
- Maybe touch on field of view

- Tested out with my monitor using sub-resolutions, and Rebecca's new monitor
- Switched monitors
    - Why this works for me
        - Focused Office work on my desktop
        - I use workspaces
        - Fits both my max + split rules
        - Ideal

### Conclusion
- Everyone's needs are different at the end of the day
- However, I don't think we should equate "more, larger screens" to a
    "productive setup"
- There needs to be *real* reason for it, and it isn't always obvious
