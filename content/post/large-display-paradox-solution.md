About a year ago, I [switched to using LG's ud4379b, a single 42.5" 4k IPS
monitor](/post/new-lgud4379b/). My motivation to *switch* monitors was mostly
to convert to an IPS panel. My *selection of monitor* on the other hand, was an
attempt to simplify my hardware by only having a single monitor. I wanted a
single monitor, but not at the cost of loosing the 2x(1920x1080) resolution my
duel 1080p setup had, because [everyone knows]() [that multiple monitors]()
[are required]() [to get any real work]() [done,]() [especially programming]().
After a year of my large display with a massive resolution, I started to
feel the large  display paradox.

### Background
- Quick refresh on previous setup
- What I switched to
- *Why* I switched to that setup

### The Large Display Paradox
- Background information on what the "Large Display Paradox" is
- Talk a bit about the research
- Number of Screens vs. Total Resolution
- Maybe touch on field of view



### My Experience and Solution
- Out of my field of view
- Couldn't easily window manage
    - My new "maximize window" requirement
    - Still like to split when needed
    - 2560x1440 is great for this
- Tested out with my monitor using sub-resolutions, and Rebecca's new monitor
- Switched monitors
    - Why this works for me
        - Focused Office work on my desktop
        - I use workspaces
        - Fits both my max + split rules
        - Ideal

### Conclusion
- Everyone's needs are different at the end of the day
- However, I don't think we should equate "more, larger screens" to a
    "productive setup"
- There needs to be *real* reason for it, and it isn't always obvious
