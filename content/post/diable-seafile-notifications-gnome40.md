This should be a short and quick post. Basically, I have had issues figuring out
and then remembering how to disable Seafile notifications when setting up Gnome
on an machine, because of how they hide desktop icons. I need to disable this
now, because I sync my obsidian with Seafile, so it constantly sends
notifications when I'm writing notes otherwise. Because I'm apt to forget my
work-around, I'll document it in a post even though it's a unique case.

## Install Try Icons: Reloaded extension

The first step is to install an extension that allows application tray icons.
One extenstion that seems to "work" as of now (with a catch, more on that
below), is [Tray Icons: Reloaded](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2890/tray-icons-reloaded/). 


## Switch to an Xorg Session (this is the step I always forget)


## Use the now visible Seafile desktop icon to open it's settings, and disable the notifications
