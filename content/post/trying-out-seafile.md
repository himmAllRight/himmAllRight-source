When I was in college, I mostly used Dropbox to handle all of my file syncing
needs. As I approached graduation, I setup an Owncloud droplet (which is now a
Nextcloud instance) to replace my Dropbox usage. While it has worked fairly well
over the years, I've been watching [seafile](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/)
out of the corner of my eye the last few years, but haven't taken the time to
try it out. I have now, and I like it.

As stated on their website:

>Seafile is an enterprise file hosting platform with high reliability and
>performance. Put files on your own server. Sync and share files across
>different devices, or access all the files as a virtual disk.

The desktop client is simple, but nice. It responds quickly, and is a nice
little command center where I can see how seafile is configured on each system.
Seafile libraries allow me to not sync everything on each machine, but only what
I need. Nextcloud had this feature, but it was used a little differently. I had
to go to the `Nextcloud` folder in the client UI, and then check/uncheck all of
the sub-folders I wanted to sync on my machine.
