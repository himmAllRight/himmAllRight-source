When I was in college, I mostly used Dropbox to handle all of my file syncing
needs. As I approached graduation, I setup an Owncloud droplet (which is now a
Nextcloud instance) to replace my Dropbox usage. While it has worked fairly well
over the years, I've been watching [seafile](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/)
out of the corner of my eye the last few years, but haven't taken the time to
try it out. I have now, and I like it.
