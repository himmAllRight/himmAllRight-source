For the past month, I have been learning to type on... my new keyboard. A few
weeks ago, I purchased an [ergodox-ex]() and have been using it ever since. Now
that I am mostly comfortable on it... here are my initial thoughts.

## Previous Keyboard

*Picture of my HHKB?*

For the past few years, I have been using a [Happy Hacking Pro]() keyboard.
Before that, I was on a [Happy Hacking Lite](), which I started using while I
was in college. I love the HHK and still think it's an amazing keyboard. (It's
why I think *every* keyboard should have `ctrl` instead of a `caps` key, or at
least switch to two...)


## Motivations for a new one

While I love my HHKB and had no real complaints, there were a few things that
motivated me to get a new keyboard.


### Was getting the itch to build one again

The first reason was that I was slowly getting the itch to build a mechanical
keyboard again. When I purchased my HHKB Pro, it was actually as a result of a
canceled planck kit from mass.com. My goal was to learn how to soder (I even
brought my iron then), and build the keyboard from scratch. By buying the HHKB,
I never got to scratch that itch. While I *technically* still haven't... this
is what had me looking at keyboards and browsing
[/r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) in the
first place...

### Wanted a program-able board

More importantly than *physically* building a keyboard, I wanted to be able to
*programatically* build it, i.e. play with custom firmware. This is something
that my HHKB doesn't really have, that the plank did. Even the pok3r which I've
considered in the past had programmable layers. Even some of [System76's
laptops](https://system76.com/laptops)
now allow the ability to remap their keyboards using open firmware
(which is awesome!). So, probably the *biggest* thing I wanted in a new
keyboard was the ability to customize and program the layers and layouts.

## What I don't love
There's honestly not I don't *like*, but here is a thing or two that I maybe
don't *love*..

### Brown switches are a bit sensitive?


### Learning curve


### Cost
