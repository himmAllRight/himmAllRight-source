For the past month, I have been learning to type on... my new keyboard. A few
weeks ago, I purchased an [ergodox-ex]() and have been using it ever since. Now
that I am mostly comfortable on it... here are my initial thoughts.

## Previous Keyboard

*Picture of my HHKB?*

For the past few years, I have been using a [Happy Hacking Pro]() keyboard.
Before that, I was on a [Happy Hacking Lite](), which I started using while I
was in college. I love the HHK and still think it's an amazing keyboard. (It's
why I think *every* keyboard should have `ctrl` instead of a `caps` key, or at
least switch to two...)


## Motivations for a new one

While I love my HHKB and had no real complaints, there were a few things that
motivated me to get a new keyboard.


### Was getting the itch to build one again

The first reason was that I was slowly getting the itch to build a mechanical
keyboard again. When I purchased my HHKB Pro, it was actually as a result of a
cancled planck kit from mass.com. When the order was mistakenly canceled

### Wanted a program-able board


### I was starting to learn proper touch typing and wanted ortholinear again


### My shoulders started really having issues


## Considerations

### Moonlander


### Ergodox


## Ordering and shipping


## Customizing


### Some issues with Wally


### Some changes I have now


## Getting used to and learning the board


## What I like

### Customizeability


### Ortholinear


### Split Design


### Thumb keys


## What I don't love
There's honestly not I don't *like*, but here is a thing or two that I maybe
don't *love*..

### Brown switches are a bit sensitive?


### Learning curve


### Cost


## Conclusion
