For the past month, I have been learning to type on... my new keyboard. A few
weeks ago, I purchased an [ergodox-ex]() and have been using it ever since. Now
that I am mostly comfortable on it... here are my initial thoughts.

## Previous Keyboard

*Picture of my HHKB?*

For the past few years, I have been using a [Happy Hacking Pro]() keyboard.
Before that, I was on a [Happy Hacking Lite](), which I started using while I
was in college. I love the HHK and still think it's an amazing keyboard. (It's
why I think *every* keyboard should have `ctrl` instead of a `caps` key, or at
least switch to two...)


## Motivations for a new one

While I love my HHKB and had no real complaints, there were a few things that
motivated me to get a new keyboard.


### Was getting the itch to build one again

The first reason was that I was slowly getting the itch to build a mechanical
keyboard again. When I purchased my HHKB Pro, it was actually as a result of a
canceled planck kit from mass.com. My goal was to learn how to soder (I even
brought my iron then), and build the keyboard from scratch. By buying the HHKB,
I never got to scratch that itch. While I *technically* still haven't... this
is what had me looking at keyboards and browsing
[/r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) in the
first place...

### Wanted a program-able board

More importantly than *physically* building a keyboard, I wanted to be able to
*programatically* build it, i.e. play with custom firmware. This is something
that my HHKB doesn't really have, that the plank did. Even the pok3r which I've
considered in the past had programmable layers. Even some of [System76's
laptops](https://system76.com/laptops)
now allow the ability to remap their keyboards using open firmware
(which is awesome!). So, probably the *biggest* thing I wanted in a new
keyboard was the ability to customize and program the layers and layouts.


### I was starting to learn proper touch typing and wanted ortholinear again

*Ortholinear/Touch Typing diagram?*

Working in mostly the same space for much of this year, I've started to notice
that my wrists and arms have really started to tighten up again thoughout the
week. So, I put my foot down and decided it was time again to try to force
myself to use *proper* tough typing... with all my fingers. I normally slide
my hands across the board and have just a few fingers do the bulk of the work.
This not only creates unnessicary movement, but also over strains parts of my
hands, building tension on my wrists.

As I started typing with proper finger use, I noticed my hands *really* have a
hard time hitting some keys... particually the bottom row, especially with my
left hand. My other fingers just seem to block the path the "correct" finger
needs to get to the key. It seemed obvious why I naturally adapted to sliding
across the board over the years. I wondered if an
[ortholinear layout]() would better allow me to touch type properly, using all
of my fingers.


### My shoulders started really having issues

The last straw that switched my keyboard urgency to something I *needed* to
order *now*, was that my shoulder was starting to hurt... all the time. When I
was split keyboards in my search, I realized they could probably help a lot to
alleviate some of my pain. Being able to type with my arms out at any width
would at least allow me to move the shoulder angle around as it got sore. So, I
switched from looking at DIY planck and similar kits, and started looking at
pre-built split keyboards that I could have shipped, quicker than taking months
to order and build.

## Considerations

With the requirements figured out, I started searching for my keyboard. Both
keyboards I considered are actually made and sold from
[ZSA](https://zsa.io). I chose them because giving the
shoulder problems I was having, I wanted something that would arrive soonish
and already built. Plus, they have very good reviews and seem to be highly
recommended.

### Moonlander

The first keyboard I considered was actually the new
[Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/). It had *just* been released. I
loved how it looked with it's floating keys, and slim profile. It was
apparently more portable, coming with it own carrying case. It seemed to
be a fresh new take on the classic ergodox, with a neat folding design and
newer features like usb-c connection.

</center>

I had to dig deep to learn anything about the moonlander as there were only a
handful of people that had them at the time. As I dug, I passively learned
more and more about the ergodox...


### Ergodox-EZ

So the moonlander seems to be a respin of the classic keyboard ZSA also sells,
the [ergodox-ez](https://ergodox-ez.com). The ergodox-ez is a pre-built version
of the well-known (to keyboard nerds...),
[open-source](https://github.com/Ergodox-io), split keyboard, the
[ergodox](https://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox).
