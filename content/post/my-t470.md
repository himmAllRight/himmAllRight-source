In my last post, I talked about how I sold off my System76 Bonobo laptop, and
 planned to replace it with a new computer. Well, I did... awhile ago. For the
 last few months, I have been using a Lenovo T470 Thinkpad (with dock) as my new
 daily driver. Here's what I think.

## The Choice

The
[T470](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470-Core-i5-Full-HD-Notebook-Review.198130.0.html)
is the 14" model of Lenovo's "business" laptop lineup. The T470 series actually
has several variants itself, including the "high end"
[T470s](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470s-Core-i7-WQHD-Laptop-Review.200880.0.html),
that has a slimmer chassis, made from "higher quality materials", and a better
screen compared to the T470. There is also the "high
performance"[T470p](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470p-Core-i7-GeForce-940MX-Laptop-Review.226802.0.html),
which features a faster, quad-core CPU, but a slightly larger chassis. While
these variants caught my attention, I ultimately decided on the normal T470
because I liked that I could max it out at 32GBs of RAM (The T470s can only do
24), and has an internal *and* external battery bridged battery system. Lastly,
I assumed that the combination of having a lower powered CPU (compared to the
T70p), but a slightly larger case (compared to the T480s) would make it the
optimal choice concerning my heat/noise concerns outlined in the previous post.

So, the T470 then... 

I got my T470 from a vendor on Ebay. It came configured with a 2.5GHz (3.1 GHz
Turbo) i5-7200u cpu, 8 GBs of DDR4 RAM, the 1920x1080 screen, and a 500GB Hard
Drive with Windows 10 on it. After checking that it booted up fine and
everything, I immedately swapped the slow HD with the 250GB SSD that was in my
x230, and installed [Solus](https://solus-project.com) on it. In Solus,
everything seemed to work "right out of the box", and I presume it would be the
same with other Linux distributions. For Christmas, I got a new 500GB Samsung
EVO SSD to upgrade the 250GB one. I have less total storage than the Bonobo had,
but *all* of it is fast SSD storage, and I'm learning how to better use my
server for storage, so it all works out <i class="fa fa-smile-o"

<div class="caption">Installing Solus the first night</div>

While I still plan to upgrade the T470 in the future, here are it's specs at the
time of writing this post. 

```
T470 Thinkpad
Intel i5-7200u [2.5 Ghz (3.1 Ghz Turbo), 2 Cores, 4 Threads]
8 GB RAM
500 GB Samsung EVO SSD
14" 1920x1080 IPS Display 
Solus
```

The hardware on the T470 is nice, and the technical specs are *okay*, but the
real killer feature regarding my switch to a Thinkpad for my main device is that
I also purchased the ThinkPad Ultra Dock (40A2). This means that I am able to
*easily* take advantage of my periphery devices whenever I am working at my
desk. 

```
Thinkpad Ultra Dock 40A2
2 x 23.6" ASUS 1920x1080 Monitors
Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro2 
Audioengine A2+ Speakers & Stands
Bose AE2 Headphones
Logitech HD Pro Webcam c920 Widescreen
Blue Yeti Microphone - Backout Edition
Inateck USB 3.0 to SATA Dual-Bay Hard Drive Docking Station
```


## What I like

<div class="caption">I've enjoyed the portability and great keyboard of the T470</div>

Now that I've provided the background information and summary, I'll quickly list
what I *like* and *do not like* about my new T470.

- **Cool & Quiet** - After realizing that I am picky when it comes to heat and
  noise in computers, one of my biggest goals when replacing my old computer was
  to find one that made less noise, and generated less heat. Well, I think I did
  well there. *This thing is silent.* Using the great command line app
  [s-tui](https://amanusk.github.io/s-tui/), I have observed that most of the
  time when I'm writing code, browsing the web, or listening to music, the fans
  don't even kick on. When I do push the machiene a little bit by running VMs,
  or being on a video conference, the do kick up, but even then I have to put my
  ear right against the computer to hear anything. Even at it's loudest, the
  T470 is a very quiet device.
  
- **Size & Portability** - I love the size and portabilty of this laptop. The
  14" form factor is large enough that I don't feel cramped when I have to use
  it as a stand-alone device, but it is still small enough that I can easily
  throw it in my bag and bring it with me. While I wouldn't mind the T470
  shedding a *little* weight, I find it's thickness perfectly acceptable for my
  uses (hear that Apple?). It is a solid machine. When I rest my hands on it to
  type, they feel fully supported and there is *zero* flex. When I hold the
  closed laptop, it feels like it could take quite a beating and still be
  fine... and I love that.
  
- **Keyboard & Trackpoint/pad** - It's a Thinkpad keyboard. The keys are
  adequately spaced, have travel (though not as much as my x230), and feel
  *crisp* when typed rather than mushy. It has a track*point* with physical
  buttons, which at this point I don't think I could do without (Crap.
  Unintentional pun. I'm leaving it.). While I don't use it often, the
  track*pad* is also quite nice. It is an ideal size, and rubberized texture own
  it which prevents my fingers from feeling raw after long use. I find it hard
  for others laptops to compete with the Thinkpad's keyboard/trackpoint setup.
  
- **Dock-able**

- **Thunderbolt/USB C**

- **Battery(s)**

## What I don't like

- **The Screen**

- **Trackpoint**

- **Graphics?**

- **Performance? Not really tho...**

## Future Plans

<div class="caption">The empty RAM slot I hope to add a 16GB stick to... if prices ever drop again...</div>

* Keep dock as main sit at device, remote to power
* Upgrade SSD (Done)
* Upgrade RAM (too expensive)
* Better Battery Configuration
* New Monitor?
* Maybe get eGPU?
* Maybe eventually build a Workstation
  * Would be more of Server type build
  * Still remote to it
