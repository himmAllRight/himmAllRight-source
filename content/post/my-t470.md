In my last post, I talked about how I sold off my System76 Bonobo laptop, and
 planned to replace it with a new computer. Well, I did... awhile ago. For the
 last few months, I have been using a Lenovo T470 Thinkpad (with dock) as my new
 daily driver. Here's what I think.

## The Choice

The
[T470](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470-Core-i5-Full-HD-Notebook-Review.198130.0.html)
is the 14" model of Lenovo's "business" laptop lineup. The T470 series actually
has several variants itself, including the "high end"
[T470s](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470s-Core-i7-WQHD-Laptop-Review.200880.0.html),
that has a slimmer chassis, made from "higher quality materials", and a better
screen compared to the T470. There is also the "high
performance"[T470p](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T470p-Core-i7-GeForce-940MX-Laptop-Review.226802.0.html),
which features a faster, quad-core CPU, but a slightly larger chassis. While
these variants caught my attention, I ultimately decided on the normal T470
because I liked that I could max it out at 32GBs of RAM (The T470s can only do
24), and has an internal *and* external battery bridged battery system. Lastly,
I assumed that the combination of having a lower powered CPU (compared to the
T70p), but a slightly larger case (compared to the T480s) would make it the
optimal choice concerning my heat/noise concerns outlined in the previous post.

## The Specs

So, the T470 then... 

I got my T470 from a vendor on Ebay. It came configured with a 2.5GHz (3.1 GHz
Turbo) i5-7200u cpu, 8 GBs of DDR4 RAM, the 1920x1080 screen, and a 500GB Hard
Drive with Windows 10 on it. After checking that it booted up fine and
everything, I immedately swapped the slow HD with the 250GB SSD that was in my
x230, and installed [Solus](https://solus-project.com) on it.

* Keep dock as main sit at device, remote to power
* Upgrade SSD (Done)
* Upgrade RAM (too expensive)
* New Monitor?
* Maybe get eGPU?
* Maybe eventually build a Workstation
  * Would be more of Server type build
  * Still remote to it
