After years of using the [password store](https://www.passwordstore.org/) as my
password manager, I am switching things up. Over vacation, I started
transferring my password to [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). I have finally
finished transferring all of my passwords and will be switching over to use it
as my main password manager. Here are my thoughts so far.

### Why Switch?
First of all, I want to point out that I had already started my switch *before*
the large bitwarden segment on the [recent episode of Linux
Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com/316). That was just a re-assuring
coincidence.


#### Easier Setup

#### Mobile Support

#### Easier to share if I want down the road

### What I like
#### Availability
Like other recent switches, motivated by wanting access on both computer and
phone/ipad. Bitwarden has clients for all.

#### Easy Setup
Flatpak + App and login. This will make it easier as I continue to work on
building automated "throw-away" work environments.

#### Sharing
I think if I move my wife to it in the future, it should be possible to have
shared passwords.

### What I am still learning
Normally, this is where I list the few things that I "don't like". However,
this is all new still and I *think* the majority of my current issues are
solvable, but I just haven't figured it out yet. So it's a "What I'm still
learning" section (•‿•) .

#### Better keyboard/DE integration

#### Multi-User Support

### Conclusion
