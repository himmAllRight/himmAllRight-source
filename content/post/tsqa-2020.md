## TSQA 2020

- What it is, location, date, etc.
- Getting there, meeting up with co-workers


### Keynote


### Talks summary



- Other things, lunch, attendees, etc


## My Main Take-aways

### It was a great conference

### Diverse

### I learned some things to work on

#### Remember who's writting the tests
#### Look into BDD?
#### No failing tests
Start thinking about automated tests as showing the 'state' of the
system, and failures indicate any deviation from that state. This
might mean that I write a test that shows a *known bug* is
occuring. But that's fine, because we *know* that bug happens, and if
anything changes, we should know. When the bug is fixed, we can update
or remove that test. To take things a step further, when we write the
test, we should document it with a message like *"See Issue
#XXXX. Remove/update when that issue is resolved*" with a description on *why* the test exists and *what* we expect to know about the state from it's results.

A passed or failed test is a data point, not a defect.

So on that note....

#### Better Documentation

*<< Insert meme about development documentation?? >>*



## Conclusion

Overall, I think what I took away from the conference was a set of
different ways to look at everything in my role as a QE.
