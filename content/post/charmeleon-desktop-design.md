Over the past few years (particularly since moving to the [T470](../my-t470/)
as my main device, I have been anticipating what an eventual desktop
workstation build will look like. For awhile, I was convinced that I was going
to make a [muti-socket, used xeon
build](https://www.techspot.com/review/1155-affordable-dual-xeon-pc/). In 2017
however, AMD released their [Ryzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen)
CPUs, which caught my attention.

## Why a Desktop?

My laptops have served the majority of my needs well the last few years, I have
been feeling a bit restricted when trying to do more complicated and demanding
tasks. While I still agree with a "*interface with a low-powered, portable
computer, and remote into more powerful ones when needed*" mentality, I enjoy
having *one* of those power computers being my physical, main workstation
desktop.

## Workstation Goals

As much as people may think I want to build a computer for the fun of it, if
I'm designing a workstation, I have goals in mind for it. Additionally, 98% of
online build guides are for designing *gaming* desktops... which is not what I
was doing. So, what I wanted *my build* to have, likely deviates from the
much of the *suggested* guidance found online.

#### More Cores
#### Lots of Ram
#### Fast Storage
#### *Some* Gaming Ability
#### Good Budget "Base", Ability to Upgrade

## Other Considerations

#### CPUs
- Ryzen 7 1700
- Ryzen 7 2700
- Ryzen 5 2400g

#### GPUs
- RX 580
- RX 570
- Vega 11 (in the 2400g)

#### MBs
- MSI B450 Pro Gaming AC Carbon

**- CPU: Ryzen 5 2600 -**

**- Motherboard: MSI B450 Tomahawk -**

**- RAM: G.Skill - Trident Z 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4-3200Mhz RAM -**

**- GPU: Sapphire 1024 4GB PULSE Radeon RX 560 -**

**- Case: Fractal Design - Meshify C Dark TG ATX Mid Tower -**

**- PSU: EVGA - SuperNOVA G4 650W 80+ Gold, fully modular ATX PSU -**
