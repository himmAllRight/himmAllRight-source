In the age of services such as [Amazon
Workspaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/),and [V2 Cloud
Workspaces](https://v2cloud.com/products/workspaces/), amung many
others, I feel obligated it point out that virtual "cloud" workspaces
can be easily setup and created at home, using Linux. While these
services provide the obvious advantage of being hosted and maintained
in a large data-center, if you don't need that... roll your own. I'll
show you how.
