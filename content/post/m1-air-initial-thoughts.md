## Background? (what I ordered)

*Maybe a picture of the box?*

Ordered the new MacBook Air the other day, and will trade in my 16‚Äù MacBook Pro for it. I got the second tier model (Silver, 8 gpu cores, 512GB ssd) and upgraded the RAM to 16Gb.




## What I Like

*A nice picture of the air*

- It's cool and quiet
- The physical function keys are nice, especially once I figured out how to still utilize BTT to do amazing window management keyboard shortcuts.
- Rosetta II is amazing at what it does
- Instant on is crazy. Honestly, I thought my sleep settings were misconfigured and it just wasn't turning off when I shut the lid. It's something I wasn't directly excited about (besides the instant resolution switching, if that's related) but once I tried it, it made my 16" feel unbearably slow for the few days I had both.
- It works surprisingly well at my desk on the stand. Possibly even better than the 16" (more stable, is about the size of the stand, so I'm able to push it out of the way easier.) For the content I usually have on that screen,(background videos or nothing usually) the size difference isn't really that big of a deal either. I am also more comfortable closing it to focus on the single screen, almost as if I was using a mac mini.
- Garage band (at least initially, I have to try again now that time has passed... actually thinking about it,[TODO] I need to make sure I have the libraries downloaded and stuff, as I bet that was a big contributor to the issues on the 16") seemed so much better. It just opened up instantly and was ready. My 16" would take forever to load it, and would seem to not respond and crash
- My terminal/shell instantly open! For some reason on my mac, it always took a second to load my prompt in iterm with my shell config. On the air, instant.
- The battery life is great. I don't really think about it.

## What Could be Better

*Possibly a picture of the screen, and it's thick bezels? (with or without the MBP next to it)*

- I miss the speakers on the 16".
- The screen bezels are rather thick, even compared to the 16" and could use
some slimming.
- Some things are still tricky to install. For example, I had to compile `neofetch` from scratch in `homebrew`, but I imagine that should be better with time. Overall though, I haven't really had any major installation issues.

## What's... Different?

<div class="caption">The MacBook Air does not have a touchbar</div>

- The Efficiency cores are weird
- Not having the touch bar surprisingly. Not that I *miss* it, but I
apparently got used to checking the time there and had to slowly break that
habit.

### Compared to the 16"?


Not sure if I'll do this as a separate/sub section of if comparisons will be littered throughout the post. It might be a combination of both, where I reference the comparison in places and might have a synopsys/summary of the comparisons here, before the final conclusion...


## Conclusions

*Some sort of 'grab-and-go' pic of the air and/or pic of my old small computers?*

*Or, a nice desk shot with the air*

- At first, it reminded me of swapping down to some of my previous *portable* laptops, like the x230 and my x201e. Which is a good thing. I loved both of those computers and their ability to be thrown in a bag on the go. It turns out, it has about the same footprint as both of them, but is thinner, had more screen space, and is magnitudes more powerful.
