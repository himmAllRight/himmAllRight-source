As discussed in my [previous post](/post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/), I decided
to trade in my 2019 16" MacBook Pro, and replace it with a new 2020 M1
MacBook Air. So far, the swap has been going great. Here are my initial
thoughts...

## Background? (what I ordered)

To recap, I got the 'second tier model' 2020 M1 MacBook Air (Silver, 8 gpu
cores, 512GB ssd) and upgraded the RAM to 16Gb. I wanted to maintain the same
RAM and storage that my MBP had. After way too many weeks (3+), the air
showed up at my door.


## What I Like

First, lets start with the good. There is a lot to say here, but these are my
main thoughts:

- It's cool and ~~quiet~~ *silent*. It really doesn't heat up often, and when
it does it is *barley* noticeable*

- It very portable and easy to grab and go with.

- I like having physical function keys again, especially now that I figured
out how to still utilize [BetterTouchTool] to do window management using keyboard shortcuts
instead of the touch bar.

- Instant on (name?) is crazy. Honestly, I thought my sleep settings were
misconfigured and it just wasn't turning off when I shut the lid. It's
something I wasn't directly excited about (besides the instant resolution
switching, if that's related) but once I tried it, it made my 16" feel
unbearably slow for the few days I had both.

- Rosetta II is amazing at what it does. Most apps just work because of it,
even if they haven't been ported to M1 yet. This has made the transition
rather seamless.

- It works surprisingly well at my desk on the stand. Possibly even better
than the 16" (more stable, is about the size of the stand, so I'm able to
push it out of the way easier.) For the content I usually have on that
screen,(background videos or nothing usually) the size difference isn't
really that big of a deal either. I am also more comfortable closing it to
focus on the single screen, almost as if I was using a mac mini.

- My terminal/shell instantly open! For some reason on my mac, it always took
a second to load my prompt in iterm with my shell config. On the air,
instant.

- Garage band seemed so much better. It just opened up instantly and was
ready. My 16" would take forever to load it, and would seem to not respond
and crash.


- The battery life is great. I don't really think about it.

## What Could be Better

<div class="caption">The Air has thick bezels, even compared to my old 16" MacBook Pro.</div>

- The screen bezels are rather thick, even compared to the 16" and could use
some slimming.

- Only two ports, on only one side of the laptop.

- I miss the speakers on the 16". The air still has great *laptop*
speakers... but the 16" had *amazing* speakers.

- Some things are still tricky to install. For example, I had to compile
`neofetch` from scratch in `homebrew`, but I imagine that should be better
with time. Overall though, I haven't really had any major installation
issues.

## What's... Different?

There were a few things that we neither good nor bad, just *different* coming
from an Intel 16" MBP:

- The Efficiency cores are weird. I would look at my usage when nothing was really running and wonder why the first four cores seemed to be used so much, especially compared to the other four. Then I realized, it's because it was only using the efficiency ones, and it *should*. So while it looked like there was more work and that it wasn't being balanced, properly across the cores... it was actually shifting the load to be more efficient. This is good, but weird to get used to at first if you're someone that is constantly watching CPU usage like I tend to.

- Not having the touch bar surprisingly. Not that I *miss* it, but I
apparently got used to checking the time there and had to slowly break that
habit.

## Conclusions

This laptop has been great. It remind me of swapping down to some of my
previous *portable* laptops, like the x230 and my x201e. Which is a good
thing. I loved both of those computers and their ability to be thrown in a
bag on the go. It is a setup that pairs nicely with a powerful workstation,
which [I currently have]. While the air, has about the same footprint as both
of those previous laptops, it is thinner, has more screen space, and is
*magnitudes* more powerful. I can't complain with that.
