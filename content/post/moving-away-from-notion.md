After using [Notion](https://notion.so) for all of my notes and planning over
the [last year](/post/trying-notion/), there are a few issues with it that have
worn on me.  In fact, over time my uneasiness on the topic has built up to the
point where I am now working to move off of Notion completely. Here's why.

## Background

*A screenshot of my Notion Setup (Dashboard)*

Before getting into I, I want to state that for the most part, that I have loved
using Notion. It took a few iterations of figuring out how I wanted to organize
everything, but after the most recent system overhaul, I have it setup in a way
that really works for me.

In short, have everything stored in a handful of databases: Areas, Projects,
Tasks, and Notes.  The items in each of these DBs, are all linked together where
appropriate. For example, *tasks* and *notes* are usually contained in a
*project*, which is associated with a particular *area*.

*A screenshot of the tasks in a goal?*

In the most recent iteration, I also moved away from linking tasks to a daily
journal objects. Instead, I just assigned *everything* a date, and used date
filters and dashboards to see *Weekly* and *Daily* spreads of my task boards. I
also was able to plan out monthly goals and link tasks to them, so at the end of
the month, I was able to go back and see *exactly* when I had completed a task
for that goal.

All in all, it was a really slick system that worked amazingly... except for
when it didn't (but more on that later)...

## What I liked about Notion

*Screenshot of My notion templates?*

I'll go through these quickly, as many of them echo my [original notion
post](/post/trying-notion/)...

### Easy to use and setup. 
I can have it easily configured on all my devices. I just by install the app and
log in. I even have the option to access it in a web browser, if I cannot
install it on a device.

### The flexibility
As described in the *Background* section above, the flexability of Notion really
allowed me to customize it to whatever I needed. It wasn't as much of a system
itself, as much as it was a tool that let me build my *own* system (much like
what I've experience with emacs org-mode in the past).

### Templates. 
With such a malleable system, it helps if the more intricate components can be
automated and simplified with templates. Luckily, the template system in Notion
was very powerful, and is what really allowed me to build  up my own system. My
commonly setup items were all templated to save me time when entering new items
into my system. Without them, Notion would have been a giant pain to maintain.

### All my thoughts and ideas can be linked. 
I loved being able to link everything together. Being able to see all the tasks
linked to a project, and all of the associated notes of the project from a
dashboard was game changing in how I think about organizing my goals, 
plans, and notes in a system.

## What I didn't like about Notion

*Screenshot of being unable to connect? Or something with data issues...*

Most of these problems relate from notion be online and rather closed

### Availability to data relies on their servers being available
- While this is what makes it nice and convenient, it has problems
- This coupled with no offline support is a bad combo
- If Notion goes down, I can't use it... at all
- Because I use notion for my tasks, notes, and everything, it means if it goes
down I can't even check what I had recorded as my TODOs for a day, or quickly
jot a note down for something I'm working on. I have to do everything elsewhere,
and then transfer it over when the service comes back up (or I have internet
again)
- This doesn't happen often, but there are times my internet goes out, or I am
traveling without a connection for a bit
- Also, Notion did have an outage a bit back *link to article about outage?*

### Access to the data
- In a similar issue, all of the data and content in my Notion is controlled
entirely by Notion.
- This means any important data-related responsibility fall's entirely on
Notion's shoulders, and I can't do anything to assist them. For example...
encryption.
    - To add salt to the wound... Notion doesn't end-to-end encrypt the data
    (*TODO: Verify this is still true and link to it*)
- All the data is in a proprietary format in the databases
    - The only way to see the content, is through notion. There's no files I can view (even in a bad format), or convert.
    - Also, if Notion every disbands as a company, or is even acquired that shifts their direction over time... I'm stuck
    - If I want to move onto a new system, I can't easily reformat/import this into a new system.
- They have an exporting system, but every time I tried to use it, it froze. I tried this on several computers, many times, and with both export types available to me.

### Buggy Issues, particularly with templates
- Some of my favorite features, were the ones that seemed the buggiest and most often game me problems
- For example, there were many times when templates seemed to just not work. I would create a new item and go to apply a template, but the template content simply wouldn't load. 
    - This was common problem and prevented me from using my system until it worked. 
    - Or, I would have to forget the templates, and just manually do everything... which also sucked
- At the end of one week not too long ago (this was actually the last straw issue that prompted me to look elsewhere) I noticed mid week that all the links for my items from that week ex: linking tasks to their projects, or even the link for what *area* a task belonged to (ex: health, home, learning)... were missing. Nothing was linked. 
    - This linking is usually set automatically with the templates, so I chalked it up template issues, *again*.
    - At the end of the week (on a Friday I had off from work), I sat down to plan out my vacation day, and noticed that the items weren't linked *again*, even after I had manually fixed everything earlier in the week.
    - Things re-breaking items I had already manually fixed was the last straw for me.
    - I spent the rest of my vacation day researching alternatives for Notion. (and trying to export my data... but I already said how that went ðŸ˜–)

## Conclusion

*Just a Notion Screenshot I guess?*

So in conclusion, I think Notion is a great product, with a bunch of issues. I
recognize that many of the items that I feel strongly about, won't be problems
for others. In fact, I was able to overlook many of them *because* of how great Notion was. 

Over the past year however, the concern and guilt has been building up in the
back of my mind. No matter how great it is, if I can't access the system
offline, or have some sort of control with the data, it's a product that's just
waiting for me to replace it. Couple that with the buggy experience I had, and I
am making moves not to leave Notion entirely.
