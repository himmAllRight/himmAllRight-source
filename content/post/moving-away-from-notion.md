After using [Notion](https://notion.so) for all of my notes and planning over
the [last year](/post/trying-notion/), there are a few issues with it that have
worn on me.  In fact, over time my uneasiness on the topic has built up to the
point where I am now working to move off of Notion completely. Here's why.

## Background

*A screenshot of my Notion Setup (Dashboard)*

Before getting into I, I want to state that for the most part, that I have loved
using Notion. It took a few iterations of figuring out how I wanted to organize
everything, but after the most recent system overhaul, I have it setup in a way
that really works for me.

In short, have everything stored in a handful of databases: Areas, Projects,
Tasks, and Notes.  The items in each of these DBs, are all linked together where
appropriate. For example, *tasks* and *notes* are usually contained in a
*project*, which is associated with a particular *area*.

*A screenshot of the tasks in a goal?*

In the most recent iteration, I also moved away from linking tasks to a daily
journal objects. Instead, I just assigned *everything* a date, and used date
filters and dashboards to see *Weekly* and *Daily* spreads of my task boards. I
also was able to plan out monthly goals and link tasks to them, so at the end of
the month, I was able to go back and see *exactly* when I had completed a task
for that goal.

All in all, it was a really slick system that worked amazingly... except for
when it didn't (but more on that later)...

## What I liked about Notion

*Screenshot of My notion templates?*

I'll go through these quickly, as many of them echo my [original notion
post](/post/trying-notion/)...

### Easy to use and setup. 
I can have it easily configured on all my devices. I just by install the app and
log in. I even have the option to access it in a web browser, if I cannot
install it on a device.

### The flexibility
As described in the *Background* section above, the flexibility of Notion really
allowed me to customize it to whatever I needed. It wasn't as much of a system
itself, as much as it was a tool that let me build my *own* system (much like
what I've experience with emacs org-mode in the past).

### Templates. 
With such a malleable system, it helps if the more intricate components can be
automated and simplified with templates. Luckily, the template system in Notion
was very powerful, and is what really allowed me to build  up my own system. My
commonly setup items were all templated to save me time when entering new items
into my system. Without them, Notion would have been a giant pain to maintain.

### All my thoughts and ideas can be linked. 
I loved being able to link everything together. Being able to see all the tasks
linked to a project, and all of the associated notes of the project from a
dashboard was game changing in how I think about organizing my goals, 
plans, and notes in a system.

## What I didn't like about Notion

*Screenshot of being unable to connect? Or something with data issues...*

### Availability to data relies on their servers being available
Notion is completely hosted online. While this can be *convenient*, Notion also
does not currently have a viable solution for [working
offline](https://www.notion.so/How-can-I-use-Notion-offline-de55148f97c84de3b6e71aa058906be4).
This means that if the Notion service goes down... I can't access *anything.

Because I use notion for my tasks, notes, and everything else, it meant if it
went down, I couldn't even check what I had TODOs I had recorded for the day, or
quickly jot a note down about something I was working on. I had to record
everything somewhere, and go back and transfer it into Notion whenever the
service came back up. While *the service* didn't go down often, this problem
would also happen whenever my internet went out, or I was traveling and didn't
have a connection. Combined, this meant I faced this issue often enough to be
annoyed/concerned by it.

### Access to the data

A similar issue to everything being hosted by Notion, is that all of the data
and content is controlled by Notion, and in a non-standard format. This means
any important data-related responsibility fall's entirely on their shoulders,
and I have to accept whatever level of security they want to do.

While data security is very important, the problem that most concerns me is that
all the data is in a non-standard format in the databases. While the page
content is in markdown-ish format, the only way to see everything organized
properly in the databases (without hassle, as far as I know), is in notion.
There are no raw files I can easily view or convert. They have an exporting
system, but every time I tried to use it, it froze. I tried this on several
computers, many times, and with both export types available to me. So even while
in theory you *can* export everything to `md`... I couldn't.

What has me most concerned about this data formatting, is that if Notion every
disbands as a company, or is acquired by a company that slowly shifts their
direction over time (or honestly, if Notion themselves shift how they work over
time)... I'm stuck. If I want to move to a different system, I can't easily
reformat/import my data into a new system either. This reason alone has been a
hesitancy in the back of my head, my entire time using Notion.

### Buggy Issues, particularly with templates
The problem that ultimate pushed me to the edge, making me actually decide to
switch away from Notion, was just the annoying bugs glitches I kept
experiencing. Unfortunately, some of my favorite features, were the ones that
seemed the buggiest and most often game me problems

For example, there were many times when templates just didn't seem not to work.
I would create a new item and apply a template... but the template content would
*not* load. This was an issue I experienced very frequently. Considering how
much I relied on templates, I would have to either wait till a later time when
it would work again, or manually setup everything. Neither of these choices were
very *productive*.

The last straw prompting me to switch occurred at the end of one week not too
long ago. I noticed mid-week that all of the database links for each item that
week (linking tasks to their projects, or even the link for what *area* a task
belonged to (ex: health, home, learning)... were missing. Nothing was linked. 
  
 Normally, this linking is set automatically with the templates, so I chalked it
 up template issues, *again*, and manually connected everything. At the end of
 the week, on a Friday I had off from work, I sat down to plan out my vacation
 day and noticed that the items weren't linked *again*. So, I spent the rest of
 my vacation day researching alternatives for Notion. (and trying to export my
 data... but I already stated how that went ðŸ˜–).

## Conclusion

*Just a Notion Screenshot I guess?*

So in conclusion, I think Notion is a great product, but with a  few trade-offs.
I recognize that many of the items that I feel strongly about, won't be concerns
for others. In fact, I was able to overlook many of them *because* of how great

Over the past year however, my concerns about access to the data have really
been nagging in the back of my mind. Every day that passed, I felt the guilt of
having an ever-growing collection of notes that was equally growing in how
painful it would be to loose/convert if I switched away from Notion. On top of
that, every time I experienced issues with my templates. I wanted to switch
away from Notion. So now I am.

It's been a great year using a great tool. Notion is an excellent tool if you
can manage not always having access to it, and if you are okay with the chance
it might all be lost/go away someday. But for my planning and note system, I
just can't afford to use something that give me ownership of the standardized
raw files it uses.
