## Background

*A screenshot of my Notion Setup*

- I've loved using Notion
- After a few iterations of my system, I have it setup in a way that really
worked for me
    - I had stuff linked in sperate DBs (Areas, Projects, Tasks), and had items
    in them associated with them
    - I eventually also moved from having daily items, to just using dashboards
    and filters to see everything within a time window
    - I used this to plan out my goals, tasks, and projects, and link them all
    to each other with associated notes.
- Except for when it didn't
    - More on that later...

## What I like about Notion
- These might echo my original notion post...
### Easy to use and setup. 
- I can have it on all my devices, just by install the app logging in (or just
in the browser if needed)
### All my thoughts and ideas can be linked. 
- I can see what tasks are part of a project, and what notes are also associated
with them.
### Templates. 
- My commonly setup items can be templated to save me time when trying to record
new stuff into my system.

## What I don't like about Notion
Most of these problems relate from notion be online and rather closed

### Availability to data relies on their servers being available
- While this is what makes it nice and convenient, it has problems
- This coupled with no offline support is a bad combo
- If Notion goes down, I can't use it... at all
- Because I use notion for my tasks, notes, and everything, it means if it goes
down I can't even check what I had recorded as my TODOs for a day, or quickly
jot a note down for something I'm working on. I have to do everything elsewhere,
and then transfer it over when the service comes back up (or I have internet
again)
- This doesn't happen often, but there are times my internet goes out, or I am
traveling without a connection for a bit
- Also, Notion did have an outage a bit back *link to article about outage?*

### Access to the data
- In a similar issue, all of the data and content in my Notion is controlled
entirely by Notion.
- This means any important data-related responsibility fall's entirely on
Notion's shoulders, and I can't do anything to assist them. For example...
encryption.
    - To add salt to the wound... Notion doesn't end-to-end encrypt the data
    (*TODO: Verify this is still true and link to it*)
- All the data is in a proprietary format in the databases
    - The only way to see the content, is through notion. There's no files I can view (even in a bad format), or convert.
    - Also, if Notion every disbands as a company, or is even acquired that shifts their direction over time... I'm stuck
    - If I want to move onto a new system, I can't easily reformat/import this into a new system.
- They have an exporting system, but every time I tried to use it, it froze. I tried this on several computers, many times, and with both export types available to me.

### Buggy Issues, particularly with templates
- Some of my favorite features, were the ones that seemed the buggiest and most often game me problems
- For example, there were many times when templates seemed to just not work. I would create a new item and go to apply a template, but the template content simply wouldn't load. 
    - This was common problem and prevented me from using my system until it worked. 
    - Or, I would have to forget the templates, and just manually do everything... which also sucked
- At the end of one week not too long ago (this was actually the last straw issue that prompted me to look elsewhere) I noticed mid week that all the links for my items from that week ex: linking tasks to their projects, or even the link for what *area* a task belonged to (ex: health, home, learning)... were missing. Nothing was linked. 
    - This linking is usually set automatically with the templates, so I chalked it up template issues, *again*.
    - At the end of the week (on a Friday I had off from work), I sat down to plan out my vacation day, and noticed that the items weren't linked *again*, even after I had manually fixed everything earlier in the week.
    - Things re-breaking items I had already manually fixed was the last straw for me.
    - I spent the rest of my vacation day researching alternatives for Notion. (and trying to export my data... but I already said how that went ðŸ˜–)

## Conclusion

So in conclusion, I think Notion is a great product, with a bunch of issues. I
recognize that many of the items that I feel strongly about, won't be problems
for others. In fact, I was able to overlook many of them *because* of how great Notion was. 

Over the past year however, the concern and guilt has been building up in the
back of my mind. No matter how great it is, if I can't access the system
offline, or have some sort of control with the data, it's a product that's just
waiting for me to replace it. Couple that with the buggy experience I had, and I
am making moves not to leave Notion entirely.
