In my [previous post](../emacs-update-evil-usepackage/), I completely
redit my emacs configuration from scratch, building it around the use
of evil mode, and use-package. As I was wrapping, I discovered yet
another emacs package that has forever changed how I maintain my emacs
configuration... [org-babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html).
