[Gnome](https://www.gnome.org) is the default desktop environment for many
Linux distributions, including my most used one,
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org). When Gnome 3 came out years ago, I had to
utilize a bunch of [gnome extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org) to get a
functional experience. These days, between becoming more familar with the Gnome
workflow and the Gnome team ironing out the rougher edges of the DE, I don't
need to use nearly as many extensions to get going. However, to this day there
are three that I don't think I could live with out.

If you didn't know, Gnome extensions are installable enhancements to the Gnome
desktop environment.  They are installed by going to [the gnome extensions
website](https://extensions.gnome.org) with a supported browser, and swithing
desired extensions to "On". Extensions and then be further configured using the
[Tweaks] desktop application.

## My Must-Have 3


### Caffine

My first required extension is Caffine, which sets a little coffee cup icon in
the status bar. When the cup is empty, the system behaves as normal. However,
when clicked the cup 'fills up', and the extension will prevent the system from
suspending they computer's display, or sleeping the machine.

This is helpful when giving presentations to prevent the screen from dimming
off during longer slides, or during Q&A time. I also use this if I have a
secondary computer or something displaying information to prevent it from
repeatedly logging me out. I can quickly temporarily pause my sleep settings,
without having to actually go in and change them.

### Top Icons Plus

<div class="caption">The right side of my top bar, without extensions (top),
and with the *caffeine* and *top icons plus* extensions enabled (bottom)</div>
</center>

Many applications still expect an icon to be visible in a task bar to store
settings in. However, Gnome will often hide these icons, making them less
accessible. Top icons plus moves these icons back to the top status bar, like
many people expect.

I like to use this so I can more easily see and control the applications on my
system that *expect* them to be there. Top Icons plus also allows me to choose
where in the bar I want them located, but I still usually set them to the
'right' side of the screen.


### Sound Input & Output Device Chooser

<div class="caption">Top bar dropdown menu, with (right) and without (left) the
*Sound Input & Output Device Chooser* extension enabled</div>
</center>

Lastly, the Sound Input & Output Device Chooser plugin adds a drop-down menu to
the top bar when audio input and output devices can be easily switched.
Otherwise, I usually need to do this from the 'sound' section of the settings
application.

As someone that usually has more than one microphone device, switches between
speakers and headphones all day, and has 100% remote meetings, this is probably
my most *required* plugin. It makes my life so much easier to be able to switch
my inputs right from that menu.

## Conclusion

That's it. While I think default gnome has gotten surprisingly usable, I think
I would struggle to use it if these extensions were no longer available to me.
So, to the Gnome team... please consider adding this functionality as defaults
in Gnome. If not, I understand. Howver, if that is the case... Gnome community,
please don't let these extensions become deprecated XD!
