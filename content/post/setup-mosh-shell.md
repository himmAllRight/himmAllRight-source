Ever since I [built my desktop](/post/charmeleon-desktop-design/), whenever I
am working on another, more portable machine, I find myself `ssh` back to the
desktop to work on it remotely. It has the power, and much of my work flow is
in a terminal window, so why not? The only issue I have with `ssh` is that if I
have a spotty internet connection, or if I sleep/suspend my computer while
moving around, my `ssh` session is terminated.
[Tmux](/post/scripting-tmux-workspaces/) and
[tmuxinator](/post/setting-up-tmuxinator/) make this not too much of an issue,
since I can re-attach my session, but I still wish my remote session could be a
bit more seamless. They can be... by using `mosh`.
