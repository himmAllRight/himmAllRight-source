Well, last month I did something I didn't think I would do. I sold my main workstation
computer. My System76 Bonobo laptop. Some events over the last few months have made me
realize that my realistic computing *needs* are drastically different than what they were when
I purchased the Bonobo. This post will highlight some of those realizations.

## Why I got the Bonobo

I bought my Bonobo Extreme laptop from [System76](https://www.system76.com)
during my first year after graduating college. I needed to replace my desktop
that I built before my High School graduation, and used all throughout college.
My old desktop had a i7-930 CPU and 6GB of RAM with some 1TB HDs in it. While it
served me well in college, I was starting to feel restricted by it, especially
the limited RAM. I did some research and came to the conclusion that it would be
better to get a new system, rather than trying to upgrade my old desktop. I
wanted a new, powerful computer that could easily run multiple VMs and compile
software and packages fast.

Also, after a few months of work, I realized that I wasn't using a portable
computer as much. I went to work and used my work computer, and then came home
to my desktop, so portability wasn't the *biggest* concern when searching. While
I didn't need the *most* portable computer, the reality was that I still lived
out of state from my family, and would leave home for a week or more at a time
during hollidays or vacation, so I wanted to still *be able* to lug my computer
with me. I also liked to game *a little bit* with my brothers when visiting, so
I wanted a dedicated GPU if possible.

All of this pointed me towards desktop-replacement laptops. I really wanted to
support a Linux-only vendoor, so I decided to look at System76, and the Bonobo
seemed comparable to others on the market, and I knew it would support the Linux
distros I'd put on it without any issues. It was a big computer, but my plan was
to use it as a desktop most of the time, but still be able to travel with it
when I needed to go somewhere for more than just a day or two. I also liked that
the case was larger, because I hoped it would increase airflow to help with
heat/noise management.

I purchased the Bonobo, and it worked out very well for several years. It was a
very powerful computer (more than my old *desktop*), but still portable *enough*
for when I wanted to take it somewhere.


## The Modern Reality

However, some of my assumptions about my computer use turned out to not be
entirely true. Additionally, as the years passed, my computing needs started to
change from what they were when I first got the Bonobo.
