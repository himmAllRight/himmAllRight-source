Well, last month I did something I didn't think I would do. I sold my main workstation
computer. My System76 Bonobo laptop. Some events over the last few months have made me
realize that my realistic computing *needs* are drastically different than what they were when
I purchased the Bonobo. This post will highlight some of those realizations.

## Why I got the Bonobo

I bought my Bonobo Extreme laptop from [System76](https://www.system76.com)
during my first year after graduating college. I needed to replace my desktop
that I built before my High School graduation, and used all throughout college.
My old desktop had a i7-930 CPU and 6GB of RAM with some 1TB HDs in it. While it
served me well in college, I was starting to feel restricted by it, especially
the limited RAM. I did some research and came to the conclusion that it would be
better to get a new system, rather than trying to upgrade my old desktop. I
wanted a new, powerful computer that could easily run multiple VMs and compile
software and packages fast.

Also, after a few months of work, I realized that I wasn't using a portable
computer as much. I went to work and used my work computer, and then came home
to my desktop, so portability wasn't the *biggest* concern when searching. While
I didn't need the *most* portable computer, the reality was that I still lived
out of state from my family, and would leave home for a week or more at a time
during hollidays or vacation, so I wanted to still *be able* to lug my computer
with me. I also liked to game *a little bit* with my brothers when visiting, so
I wanted a dedicated GPU if possible.

All of this pointed me towards desktop-replacement laptops. I really wanted to
support a Linux-only vendoor, so I decided to look at System76, and the Bonobo
seemed comparable to others on the market, and I knew it would support the Linux
distros I'd put on it without any issues. It was a big computer, but my plan was
to use it as a desktop most of the time, but still be able to travel with it
when I needed to go somewhere for more than just a day or two. I also liked that
the case was larger, because I hoped it would increase airflow to help with
heat/noise management.

I purchased the Bonobo, and it worked out very well for several years. It was a
very powerful computer (more than my old *desktop*), but still portable *enough*
for when I wanted to take it somewhere.


## The Modern Reality

However, some of my assumptions about my computer use turned out to not be
entirely true. Additionally, as the years passed, my computing needs started to
change from what they were when I first got the Bonobo.

#### I'm Not a Big ~~PC~~ Gamer.


For example, when my brothers and I would pull out our laptops to play games
together, the games we played were never highly demanding. Our top played games
were Minecraft, Serious Sam 3, Dungeon Defenders, and *maybe* CS GO. So year. So
yea, the Bonobo was a little overkill. Unfortunately, with my brothers and I all
living in different states, we really don't see each other in person enough to
play computer games in the same room anymore. These days, when we want to
remotely play video games together... we play on Xbox ONE (which I bought mostly
to keep in touch with friends and family).

So, while I have enjoyed owning a computer that can handle most games I throw at
it...the reality is that I really don't play games too often. Even on the Xbox,
I go in bursts of playing a few times a week, and then don't touch a game for
months. While I wouldn't mind having the ability to play more demanding games on
my computer, it isn't a *requirement* for me... expecially on a laptop.

#### I Travel More. Sometimes On Airplanes.

One change compared to when I originally bought my bonobo is that I travel more.
When I first moved to Massachusetts, I figured most of my traveling would be
from here back to Pennsylvania, or to vacation once a year or so. However, my
wife and I have managed to keep in touch with some of our old friends... who
live all over the country. Additionally, now that my brothers have moved out of
the house, they have also started to spread out too (as already mentioned in the
section above). This means that I travel more often. In particular, I fly more
frequently.

The Bonobo sucks to travel with. It takes up the majority of my bag, and most
bags don't even fit it. Besides the laptop itself, TSA is often freaked out by
the MASSIVE power supply, and has had to re-scan my bag several times, thinking
I had a "bluetooth speaker" or something I refrained from telling them about,
despite my polite warnings that "my laptop's power charger is massive". It just
simply isn't a computer I can pull out of my bag and easily use in an airport
terminal. In fact, the last time I flew with it, I tried to work on it a bit at
table, and I couldn' because I don't think the power outlet supplied enough
juice to actually charge the laptop. So I had to switch to my phone to entertain
myself for several hours until my flight

## Recent Discoveries/Realizations

Do I need this section? I think it merged with the above. I think it is to talk
about learning about docking old thinkpads, but I can mention that as the
backstory for the "My New Plan" section or something. I might also change that
because it's not really *plan* at this point... I've been doing it for months
now...
