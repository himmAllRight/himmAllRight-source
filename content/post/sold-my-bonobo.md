Well, last month I did something I didn't think I would do. I sold my main workstation
computer. My System76 Bonobo laptop. Some events over the last few months have made me
realize that my realistic computing *needs* are drastically different than what they were when
I purchased the Bonobo. This post will highlight some of those realizations.

## Why I got the Bonobo

I bought my Bonobo Extreme laptop from [System76](https://www.system76.com)
during my first year after graduating college. I needed to replace my desktop
that I built before my High School graduation, and used all throughout college.
My old desktop had a i7-930 CPU and 6GB of RAM with some 1TB HDs in it. While it
served me well in college, I was starting to feel restricted by it, especially
the limited RAM. I did some research and came to the conclusion that it would be
better to get a new system, rather than trying to upgrade my old desktop. I
wanted a new, powerful computer that could easily run multiple VMs and compile
software and packages fast.

Also, after a few months of work, I realized that I wasn't using a portable
computer as much. I went to work and used my work computer, and then came home
to my desktop, so portability wasn't the *biggest* concern when searching. While
I didn't need the *most* portable computer, the reality was that I still lived
out of state from my family, and would leave home for a week or more at a time
during hollidays or vacation, so I wanted to still *be able* to lug my computer
with me. I also liked to game *a little bit* with my brothers when visiting, so
I wanted a dedicated GPU if possible.

All of this pointed me towards desktop-replacement laptops. I really wanted to
support a Linux-only vendoor, so I decided to look at System76, and the Bonobo
seemed comparable to others on the market, and I knew it would support the Linux
distros I'd put on it without any issues. It was a big computer, but my plan was
to use it as a desktop most of the time, but still be able to travel with it
when I needed to go somewhere for more than just a day or two. I also liked that
the case was larger, because I hoped it would increase airflow to help with
heat/noise management.

I purchased the Bonobo, and it worked out very well for several years. It was a
very powerful computer (more than my old *desktop*), but still portable *enough*
for when I wanted to take it somewhere.


## The Modern Reality

However, some of my assumptions about my computer use turned out to not be
entirely true. Additionally, as the years passed, my computing needs started to
change from what they were when I first got the Bonobo.

#### I'm Not a Big ~~PC~~ Gamer.


For example, when my brothers and I would pull out our laptops to play games
together, the games we played were never highly demanding. Our top played games
were Minecraft, Serious Sam 3, Dungeon Defenders, and *maybe* CS GO. So year. So
yea, the Bonobo was a little overkill. Unfortunately, with my brothers and I all
living in different states, we really don't see each other in person enough to
play computer games in the same room anymore. These days, when we want to
remotely play video games together... we play on Xbox ONE (which I bought mostly
to keep in touch with friends and family).

<a href="../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/xboxone.png"><img alt="xbox one" src="../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/xboxone.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>

So, while I have enjoyed owning a computer that can handle most games I throw at
it...the reality is that I really don't play games too often. Even on the Xbox,
I go in bursts of playing a few times a week, and then don't touch a game for
months. While I wouldn't mind having the ability to play more demanding games on
my computer, it isn't a *requirement* for me... expecially on a laptop.

#### I Travel More. Sometimes On Airplanes.

One change compared to when I originally bought my bonobo is that I travel more.
When I first moved to Massachusetts, I figured most of my traveling would be
from here back to Pennsylvania, or to vacation once a year or so. However, my
wife and I have managed to keep in touch with some of our old friends... who
live all over the country. Additionally, now that my brothers have moved out of
the house, they have also started to spread out too (as already mentioned in the
section above). This means that I travel more often. In particular, I fly more
frequently.

<a href="../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/tsa.png"><img alt="TSA logo" src="../../img/posts/sold-bonobo/tsa.png" style="max-width: 80%;"/></a>

To say it bluntly, the Bonobo sucks to travel with. It takes up the majority of
my bag, and most bags don't even fit it. Besides the laptop itself, TSA is often
freaked out by the MASSIVE power supply, and has had to re-scan my bag several
times, thinking I had a "bluetooth speaker" or something I refrained from
telling them about, despite my polite warnings that "my laptop's power charger
is massive". It just simply isn't a computer I can pull out of my bag and easily
use in an airport terminal. In fact, the last time I flew with it, I tried to
work on it a bit at table, and I couldn' because I don't think the power outlet
supplied enough juice to actually charge the laptop. So I had to switch to my
phone to entertain myself for the several hours before my flight.

#### It turns out I'm noise picky.

When building or purchasing a computer, something to consider is noise. With my
previous machines, I wouldn't worry about it. "Noise? Why should I be concerned
about that? I'm not building a recording studio!", I'd joke to myself. After
several years of focusing on how I *actually* use my computing devices, I've
noticed that I am actually very picky with noise, and on a related note, heat.
Every time I hear the fans kick up, I start to worry that I am over-taxing the
system and start to monitor the biggest culprits. When I *am* running taxing
processes, I tend to always monitor the cpu temps and don't like to seem them
high at all.

I hoped the extra *thickness* of the Bonobo would help with the heating issues.
While I think it might have helped a little bit, the reality is that when you
shove a decent GPU into a laptop... it's going to give off heat. Additionally,
when using a powerful CPU to it's full potential, it is very difficult for a
laptop to compete with a desktop-level cooling system. The Bonobo is a very
powerful laptop, but it's loud fans prevented me from actually *using* it to
it's full potential, because I would immediately start shutting down processes
when it got a little noisy. I know the fans spin up to *help* with thermals, but
I think the Bonobo was just a tad to hot and loud for my taste.


#### Desktop Replacement?

My issues with the Bonobo boiled down to the fact that based on *my current
computing use-case*, the Bonobo functioned less as a
*desktop-replacement-laptop*, and more of just a *shitty, somewhat portable,
desktop*. Most of the time, I am just browsing or writing code on the machine in
front of me. If I need more power, I connect remotely to a bigger, better,
computer. I also never game "on the go", so if I want to have a computer for
gaming, it makes much more sense to eventually have a half-decent desktop, which
will serve my needs much better that even high-end laptops.

The Bonobo is great if you sit it on a desk and use it as your full computer. I
did not. I have a ton of periphery devices, and started to even use it in
clam-shell mode, making the nice 17" screen a waste. Additionally, I hated
having to unplug and re-plug all the devices when I wanted to move the computer.
*In theory*, I could move the Bonobo from my desk into the other room and work
with my wife at the kitchen table whenever we wanted, but I *rarely* did.
Unplugging all my devices and fishing the massive power cable out from behind my
desk (because the battery life isn't... yea, I don't think I need to explain)
was enough to prompt me to treat the Bonobo as a desktop, rather than a laptop.

## Recent Discoveries & My New Plan

A while back, I bought a [used x230 Thinkpad](../my-new-used-x230/). Over the
past summer, I finally purchased a [used docking
station](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lenovo-Thinkpad-Mini-Docking-Station-Series-3-USB-3-0-T410-L420-L520-X230-T530/272238176342?epid=562055390&hash=item3f62a8e856:g:PbIAAOSw2x1XMPHU:sc:USPSPriority!02703!US!-1)
for the x230 to try out a docked setup. I loved it. It fit my needs
exceptionally. I was able to have *all* of my periphery devices attached to the
dock, and I could have my portable laptop connected to everything, or, with the
push of a button, pop the laptop from the dock and be on my way.

I want to conclude by again stating that the System76 is *not* a bad machine. It
just wasn't for me anymore.
