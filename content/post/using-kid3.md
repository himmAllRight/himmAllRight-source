Over the past few months, I have set out on the task of cleaning up and
organizing my Music library. My goals was to get rid of all the loose files,
and ensure that every item had the proper metadata so that it would
self-organize properly in the various music players I use. This task, would
not have been possible without the amazing open source (and cross-platform!)
tool, [kid3](https://kid3.kde.org).

## The Problem

*Maybe example of messy files/poorly tagged ones in music library?*

- My previous program, eztag didn't seem to be in the repos any more
- I needed a way to edit or even add metadata to man of my audio files.
- While I mostly needed it to work on Linux, I also wanted an editor for on macOS.
- It needed to be simple enough to use

## Kid3

*Screenshot of kid3?*

- Actually made by the KDE team
- I had used it before, but I didn't realize how easy it was previously.
    - Also, I didn't expect them have official builds for macOS, Windows, and Android!

## Efficiently Editing Album Tags

*screenshot of editing multiple files at once*

- After using it for a bit I built up a workflow that made the tedious task
of editing multiple files to be in a single album easier to work through.
- I learned I could select multiple files, and if I edited the field for one
of them, it applied the edits to every items selected.
- I was able to use this to write the artist, album, and year only once, instead of 10+ times.
- This made it *much more* efficient than methods I had previously used

### Conclusion

*Screenshot showing my cleaned library*

- Short post, but worth it I think.
- Mostly just want to state my gratitude and happiness that there are great open source tools out there like kid3.
- It made my life much easier, and my music library is *much* more organized now
