Over the past year or two, my notes and planning systems have been a bit of a
jumble.  It started when I attempted to switch everything to [joplin
notes](/post/switched-to-joplin-notes/)... only to eventually switch [back to
org-mode (for my work notes)](/post/back-on-org-mode-for-work/) a few months
later. Around that same time, I also started using [trello](https://trello.com)
to organize my personal and home life task boards. This system has worked well, but
feels very disjointed. My notes, goals, and tasks are spread all over the place.
This might all be about to change. I've started using
[Notion](https://notion.so).

## Quick History

Before diving into my experience with Notion, lets first describe in more
detail the system I'm coming from.

### Previous System

<div class="caption">My Trello Weekly Task Board</div>

Most recently, my personal and professional notes, and task planning systems
have consisted of three applications: Trello, Emacs (org-mode), and Joplin.

**Trello**: I had several boards for planning my weekly, monthly, and
multi-month personal tasks (including household ones). I also maintained a few
boards to keep track of goals and projects ideas (ex: future website posts, books to
read, training courses to take, etc).


**Emacs org-mode**: For my professional work life, I completed all the same tasks I
listed under the trello section, using emacs instead.  I would write down my
tasks, and log quick notes and thoughts under each one while I was working on
it. Logging helps me think through problems, and serves as a reference
later. While I *could* log notes into Trello cards, it wasn't nearly as easy to
quickly open up and record a stream of consciousness, as it is was in org mode.

**Joplin**: I previously attempted to make Joplin my universal planning system,
but it failed. It was a bit messy for a universal system, and lacked a
board style layout for  my goals and task planning (what Trello or even my [ry-org-scrum](https://github.com/himmAllRight/ry-org-scrum)
package provide). That said, it was a great cross-platform notes application...
so I continued to use it for that. Any personal or work *note* that wasn't
directly related to a single task card was stored in Joplin.

### Issues with the system

<a href="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/scrum-board.png">
<img alt="Emacs org mode" src="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/scrum-board.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My Emacs org-mode task/notes, using the task-board
package I wrote.</div>

While this system *worked*, it does some issues.

#### Couldn't share items across applications
The biggest issue I had with this framework was that it was made from several
*disconnected* systems. This meant that my notes and information were spread
all over the place, and not linkable. I tried to keep notes and task logs
separate, but while working on projects I often wanted to create longer,
stand-alone, reference *notes* related to a task. With this setup, I couldn't
easily have the two items reference each other.


#### Had to configure each application... on every device

I have [automated my emacs
setup](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/org-babel-setup/), but both joplin and
emacs still required me to manually configure their sync solutions.
Additionally, while Trello's minimal setup of 'just login' seems simple enough,
even this can quickly become tedious when doing it for multiple applications at a
time... on several devices... some of them phones.

#### Not accessible beyond my computers

Lastly, my main issue was that apart from Trello, these systems weren't really
accessable from devices beside my own. In fact Emacs wasn't even available on
my mobile devices. While good from a security standpoint, I don't like having
all my notes and information only available when I sit down at a desktop. If
I'm working on a family member's machine, or in a fresh VM (without a shared
clipboard), I want to be able to access my notes from a private browser tab. I
also like to move cards across my task board from my phone as I complete them
throughout the day.

### Desires

With these issues defined, what is it that I actually want to see in my note
taking and task organization system?

<div class="caption">Joplin Notes</div>

- **Consolidated into one system**: I don't want to setup multiple apps
    and logins on all my systems.
- **Cross platform**: Despite only wanting a single system, I want it supported
    on all my devices, including mobile.
- **Task board support**: I really enjoy moving and displaying  my task items
    in a board view.
- **Normal notes too**: In addition to task cards, I also want support for
    traditional, stand-alone notes. Ideally tasks *can* be linked to
    notes, but the notes don't *have* to be task-bound.
- **Easy to jump in, add a log note, and get out**: I love this in org-mode. I need
    the ability to quickly jump into a task, hit a keyboard shortcut to auto-insert
    a time-stamp, and write a log note.

## Notion

<div class="caption">Notion window in macOS, displaying my page for this post. The UI looks the same on the web and in my 'Nativfier' app in Linux.</div>


Notion might be my solution. The [Notion website](https://notion.so) states
that it is an "*All-in-one workspace.  Write, plan, collaborate, and get
organized â€” all in one tool*". Having used it as my lone system over the
past several weeks, I think agree.

### What I like so far
- **FLEXIBLE**: This cannot be emphasized enough. Notion is *extremely*
    flexible, providing the *tools* to setup your own system, rather than being
    a defined system itself. Want just a pile of markdown-ish notes? Fine. Want
    to create endless clusters  of relational databases? Go ahead. This endless
    flexibility makes Notion what I would consider to be the Emacs org-mode for
    ~~normal~~ *reasonable* people.

- **Easy logging using `@now`**:
<a href="/img/posts/trying-notion/now_timestamp.png">
<img alt="logging using @now" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/now_timestamp.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Easy logging using `@now`</div>
    Notion has the 'easy logging' feature I
    wanted. I just have to type `@now`, hit enter, and it auto auto-inserts a
    dynamic date and time (the 'today' changes to 'yesterday', and eventually
    the date as time passes).
- **Databases**: Databases are a compelling tool that are the backbone of a
    powerful notion setup. They allow collections of data to be linked, sorted,
    and filtered. Databases themselves have several notable features worth
    mentioning:
    - **Multiple view methods for the same data**: Database items can be displayed in
        different *views*. These include tables, boards, galleries,
        calendar, and lists.
    - **Views can be filtered and sorted using property rules**:
        Properties can be also marked as hidden, and any custom
        changes to the data view can be saved. This makes it easy to flip
        through different views to get a better picture of the information.
    - **Linkable**: A database can be embedded in a page as a 'linked database'.
        This is a database that points to an already existing
        one, and any changes to it also occur in the original DB. However,
        the linked databases have their own saved and default views.

- **Templates**: Templates are another convenient feature. A specific page
    layout can be defined as a template, which new pages can then be created
    from. For example, I have weekly templates that
    contain all the tasks and linked databases for that week automatically
    configured. So when setting up a new week, I can simply create a new page
    from the template and fill in some information. Done.

- **Accessible from all my devices**:

<img alt="Notion in iOS" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/ios_notion.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Notion views in iOS. Navigation, my 'Areas' card view,

    Notion has desktop applications for macOS and Windows, as well as
    mobile apps for iOS and Andriod. Additionally, it functions well as a webapp, which
    made it easy for me to create a
    [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) build of it to run on my Linux
    systems.

- **Free, and affordable for pro**: When I started using notion, the free tier
    was limited to 1000 blocks, but since then they have made the personal tier
    free *without* a use limit! There is still a Pro version with fancy features
    (like revision history), but even that is offered at a reasonable price.

### Downsides/Concerns

<img alt="Notion in iOS" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/notion-export.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Notion makes it easy to export an entire workspace.</div>

- **All my eggs in one basket**: My biggest concern with Notion, is that I am
    throwing everything into a single service which I now rely on. That is a *huge risk*. Fortunately,
    Notion does make it extremely easy to [export](https://www.notion.so/Workspace-settings-security-b0a64a148cad461cb6e9df74f7372ecf#23a9194abf324cb7a222ede243fdcb5b) a workspace, which eases
    my fears a bit. I need to test this out, and maybe make it a habit to
    periodically do it as a backup.
- **A bit of a steep learning curve**: All the flexibility
    and power means it can take a bit of trial and error to setup a system that
    works for you. While overwhelming at first, I don't find it to be not that
    big of an problem. I *am* coming from using mostly emacs after all :P
- **Lacks a cheaper 'Family' Plan**: I'm ecstatic that they made the personal plan
    free, but I would still love to see a 'Family' plan that would allow my
    wife and I to have shared collaborative pages. I know this is what the
    teams version provides, but we don't need all the other advanced features,
    and the price ends up being a bit steep for what we would want.

## Conclusion

In summary, I've found Notion to be amazing. I've had to redo my setup twice
already as I've started to better understand more powerful features, but every
time it has been worth it. Notion appears to be fitting my needs perfectly, and
it keeps getting better every day as I continue to tweak and perfect it.
