## Quick History

### Previous System
- Trello for planning weekly tasks/longer term goals, habit tracking
- Emacs org-mode for the same things as trello but specifically for my work
    tasks/log
- Joplin for both my personal and work collection of notes.

### Issues with system
- Have to setup everything on every device
- Emacs wasn't available on mobile devices
- Couldn't share items across systems (ex: linking to a note from a task card)

### Desires

- Consolidate to one system
- Cross platform (mobile too)
- Kanban board support
- ... BUT normal notes too
- Easy to jump in, add a log note, and get out

## Notion


### What I like so far
- FLEXIBLE
- Easy logging using `@now` (like I had in org-mode)
- Databases
    - Multiple views of same data
    - Linkable
- Have it on all my devices, or online
- Free trial, and affordable for pro

### Downsides/Concerns

- All my eggs in one basket/not open or hosted (but neither was trello)
- Can take a bit of time to learn how to best use it (but hey, I'm coming
    mostly from emacs XD )
- Cost for pro (that could raise in price) (but technically was trello, I just
    didn't think it was worth it since it only did part of what I needed. Also,
    my hosting for joplin notes was being provided by a service I pay for
    [fastmail], which I happened to already use for something else.)
- No command-line client (Honestly for this type of system, it's less and less
    important for me, especially if there is a webapp. I tend to not run my
    laptops without xorg or a windowing system anymore.
