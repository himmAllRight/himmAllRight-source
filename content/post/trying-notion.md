## Quick History

<a href="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/joplin-gui.png">

### Previous System

<a href="/img/posts/trying-notion/trello_weekly_board.png">
<img alt="Trello Weekly Board" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/trello_weekly_board.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My Trello Weekly Task Board</div>

- Trello for planning weekly tasks/longer term goals, habit tracking
- Emacs org-mode for the same things as trello but specifically for my work
    tasks/log
- Joplin for both my personal and work collection of notes.

### Issues with system

<a href="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/scrum-board.png">
<img alt="Joplin Android GUI" src="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/scrum-board.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">I love emacs and org mode... but it really isn't an option
on mobile OSes</div>

- Have to setup everything on every device
- Emacs wasn't available on mobile devices
- Couldn't share items across systems (ex: linking to a note from a task card)

### Desires

- Consolidate to one system
- Cross platform (mobile too)
- Kanban board support
- ... BUT normal notes too
- Easy to jump in, add a log note, and get out

## Notion

<div class="caption">Notion window in macOS, displaying my page for this page. The UI looks the same on the web and in my 'Nativfier' app in Linux.</div>

### What I like so far
- FLEXIBLE
<a href="/img/posts/trying-notion/now_timestamp.png">
<img alt="logging using @now" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/now_timestamp.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Easy logging using `@now`</div>
- Easy logging using `@now` (like I had in org-mode)
*Picture of Notion - Database (list + Dashboard views?)*
- Databases
    - Multiple views of same data
    - Linkable
- Templates



<a href="/img/posts/trying-notion/ios_notion.png">
<img alt="Notion in iOS" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/ios_notion.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Notion views in iOS. Navigation, my 'Areas' card views,
daily log page properties, and a task 'board' view.</div>


- Have it on all my devices, or online
- Free trial, and affordable for pro -- updated. Free for personal :)

### Downsides/Concerns

*Picture of Notion -- Something confusing?, or maybe export options*

- All my eggs in one basket/not open or hosted (but neither was trello)
- Can take a bit of time to learn how to best use it (but hey, I'm coming
    mostly from emacs XD )
- Cost for pro (that could raise in price) (but technically was trello, I just
    didn't think it was worth it since it only did part of what I needed. Also,
    my hosting for joplin notes was being provided by a service I pay for
    [fastmail], which I happened to already use for something else.)
- No command-line client (Honestly for this type of system, it's less and less
    important for me, especially if there is a webapp. I tend to not run my
    laptops without xorg or a windowing system anymore.

## Conclusion
