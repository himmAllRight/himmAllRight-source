Over the past year or two, my notes and planning systems have been a bit of a
jumble.  It started when I attempted to switch everything to [joplin
notes](/post/switched-to-joplin-notes/)... only to eventually switch [back to
org-mode (for my work notes)](/post/back-on-org-mode-for-work/) a few months
later. Around that same time, I also started using [trello](https://trello.com)
to organize my personal and home life task boards. This has system worked well, but
feels very disjointed. My notes, goals, and tasks are spread all over the place.
Anyhow, that might all be about to change. I've started using
[Notion](https://notion.so).

## Quick History

Before diving into my experience with Notion, lets first describe the system
I'm coming from.

### Previous System

<div class="caption">My Trello Weekly Task Board</div>

Most recently, my personal and professional notes + task planning system has
consisted of three applications: Trello, Emacs (org-mode), and Joplin.

**Trello**: I had several boards for planning my weekly, monthly, and
multi-month personal tasks (including household ones). I also maintained a few
boards to keep track of projects ideas (ex: future website posts, books to
read, training courses to take, etc).


**Emacs org-mode**: I continued to use emacs org-mode for essentially all the
things I just said I used trello for, but for my professional work life.  I
write down my tasks, and log quick notes and thoughts under
each one while I am working on it. This logging helps me think through
problems, and serves as a reference later. While I *could* log notes into Trello
cards, it wasn't nearly as easy to open up and record stream of consciousness
as it is in org mode.

**Joplin**: I previously attempted to make Joplin my universal planning system,
but it failed. It was a bit messy for a universal system, and lacked a
board style layout for  my goal and task planning (what Trello or even my [ry-org-scrum](https://github.com/himmAllRight/ry-org-scrum)
package provide). That said, it was a great cross-platform notes application... so
I've been using it for that. Any personal or work *note* that isn't directly
related to a single task card has been stored in Joplin.

### Issues with system

<a href="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/scrum-board.png">
<img alt="Emacs org mode" src="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/scrum-board.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My Emacs org-mode task/notes, using the task-board
package I wrote.</div>

While this system *works*, it does have it's issues.

#### Couldn't share items across systems
The biggest issue I had with this system was that it was made from several
*disconnected* systems. This meant that my notes and information were spread
all over the place, and not linkable. I tried to keep notes and task logs
separate, but while working on projects I often wanted to create longer,
stand-alone, reference *notes* related to a task. With this system, I couldn't
easily have the two reference each other.


#### Have to configure each system... on every device

I have [automated my emacs
setup](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/org-babel-setup/), but both joplin and
emacs still require me to manually configure their sync solution.
Additionally, while Trello's minimal setup of 'just login' seems easy enough,
even this quickly become tedious when doing it for multiple applications at a
time... particularly  on a phone.

#### Not accessible outside my systems

Lastly, my main issue was that apart from Trello, these systems weren't really
accessable from devices beside my own. In fact Emacs wasn't even available on
my mobile devices. While good from a security standpoint, I don't like having
all my notes and information only available when I sit down at a desktop. If
I'm working on a family member's machine, or in a fresh VM (without a shared
clipboard), I want to be able to access my notes from a private browser tab. I
also like to quickly check-off tasks from my phone as I complete them
throughout the day.

### Desires

With these issues defined, what is it that I actually want to see in my note
taking and task organization system?

<div class="caption">Joplin Notes</div>

- **Consolidated into one system**: I don't want to have to setup multiple apps
    and logins on all my systems.
- **Cross platform (mobile too)**: Despite only wanting once system, I want it
    supported on all my devices, including mobile.
- **Kanban board support**: I really enjoy moving and displaying  my task items
    in a board view.
- **Normal notes too**: In addition to task cards, I also want support for
    traditional, long-form permanent notes. Ideally tasks *can* be linked to
    notes, but the notes don't *have* to be task-bound.
- **Easy to jump in, add a log note, and get out**: Lastly is a feature that
    I love in org-mode. I want to be able to quickly jump into a note, hit a
    keyboard shortcut to drop in a timestamp, and take a quick log note.

## Notion

<div class="caption">Notion window in macOS, displaying my page for this page. The UI looks the same on the web and in my 'Nativfier' app in Linux.</div>


Notion might be my solution. The [Notion website](https://notion.so) states
that it is an "*All-in-one workspace.  Write, plan, collaborate, and get
organized â€” all in one tool*". After using it as my all-in-one system over the
past several week, I think agree.

### What I like so far
- **FLEXIBLE**: This cannot be understated. Notion is *extremely* flexible,
    providing you with the *tools* to setup your own system, rather than being
    a system itself. Want just a pile of markdown-ish notes? Fine. Want to
    create a pile of relational databases of notes link them all together? Go
    ahead. It is basically the Emacs org-mode for '"normal" (i.e. resonable)
    people.
- **Easy logging using `@now`**:
<a href="/img/posts/trying-notion/now_timestamp.png">
<img alt="logging using @now" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/now_timestamp.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Easy logging using `@now`</div>
    Notion has an 'easy logging' feature that I
    wanted. I just have to type `@now`, hit enter, and it auto auto-inserts a
    dynamic date and time (the 'today' changes to 'yesterday', and eventually
    the date as time passes).
- **Databases**: Databases are a powerful tool that are the backbone of a good
    notion setup. They allow collections of data to be linked, sorted, and
    viewed. Databases themselves have several notable features:
    - **Multiple views styles of same data**: Database items can be displayed in
        different 'views'. Some examples include table, board, cards, and list
        views.
    - **Views can also be filtered and sorted**: They can also have properties
        hidden. All of these properties can be saved as a particular 'view', so
        it can be easily selected later.
    - **Linkable**: A database can be added to a page as a 'linked database'.
        This means that it points to all the data in an already existing
        database, and any changes to it also occur in the master DB. However,
        the linked databases have their own views, which can be used for
        example to apply filters to the data.
- **Templates**: Templates are the second powerful tool behind an efficient
    notion setup. I can setup a template for a particular page layout that I
    like, and use it whenever I want to create a new one. For example, I have
    weekly and daily templates which contain all the tasks, and linked
    databases with views configured. So, when setting up a new week, I can
    simply create a new page from the template and fill in some information.
    Even more, I can set the filters of my linked database, to the *template*,
    so that when a page is instantiated from it, the value will automatically
    be set to *itself*. (This is how I have my linked databases automatically
    only display the tasks linked to that week/day).

    ^^^ Wow, too large. Please trim during edits... ^^^

- **Accessible from all my devices**:

<div class="caption">Notion views in iOS. Navigation, my 'Areas' card views,
daily log page properties, and a task 'board' view.</div>

    Notion is a webapp, but also has desktop applications for mac and window, and
    apps for Andriod and iOS. However, I made a
    [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) build of it for my Linux
    systems and it works wonderfully.

- **Free, and affordable for pro**: When I started using notion, the free tier
    was limited to 1000 blocks, but since then they have made the personal use
    *free* without a limit! There is still a Pro version with fancy features
    (like revision history), but even that is a reasonable price.

### Downsides/Concerns

<div class="caption">Notion makes it easy to export an entire workspace.</div>

- **All my eggs in one basket**: My biggest concern is that I now have all my
    eggs in this one service I'm relying on. That's a real risk. Fortunately,
    Notion makes it extremely easy to [export an entire
    workspace](https://www.notion.so/Workspace-settings-security-b0a64a148cad461cb6e9df74f7372ecf#23a9194abf324cb7a222ede243fdcb5b), which eases
    my fears a bit. I need to test this out, and maybe make it a habit to
    periodically do it as a backup.
- **Can take a bit of time to learn how to best use it**: All the flexability
    and power means it can take a bit of trial and error to figure out a system
    that works for you. It can be a bit overwhelming at first. But hey, I *am* coming
    mostly from emacs, remember? :P
- **Lacks cheap 'Family' Plan**: I'm ecstatic that they made the personal plan
    free, but I'd love to see a 'Family' plan that would allow my wife and I to
    have shared collaborative pages. I know this is what the enterprise version
    provides, but we wouldn't need any of the other features, and the price
    ends up being a bit steep for what we would need.

## Conclusion
