The past year or two has been a whirlwind of trying various notes and planning
systems. I started by attempting to switch everything to [joplin
notes](/post/switched-to-joplin-notes/) only to switch [back to org-mode for my
work notes](/post/back-on-org-mode-for-work/) a few months later. Around that
same time, I also started using [trello](https://trello.com) to organize my
personal and home life into task boards. This system worked well, but felt very
disjointed, spreading my notes, goals, and tasks all over the place. However, that all might
be able to change, as I've started using [Notion](https://notion.so).

## Quick History

Before diving into my experience with Notion, lets first describe the system
I'm coming from, highlighting some of it features and pitfalls.

### Previous System

Most recently, personal and professional notes & task planning system consisted
of three applications: Trello, Emacs (org-mode), and Joplin. They broke down as
follows:

**Trello**: I had several boards for planning my weekly, monthly, and
quarterly personal and home tasks.I also had a few boards to keep track of
projects ideas (for example, post ideas, books to read, online courses to take,
etc).


**Emacs org-mode**: I continued to use emacs org-mode for basically all the
things I just said I used trello for... but for my professional work life.
During my day job, I like to break my work down into tasks, and often logs
quick thoughts and notes under each task while I am doing it. While I could log
notes into Trello cards, it wasn't nearly as easy to open up and record stream
of consciousness as it is in org mode.

**Joplin**: I previously attempted to make Joplin my universal planning system,
but it failed. It was a bit too messy for my goal and task planning compared to
something like Trello or even org mode (with my
[ry-org-scrum](https://github.com/himmAllRight/ry-org-scrum) package installed
;) ). However, it was a great cross-platform notes application... so I've been
using it for that. Any personal or work 'note' that isn't directly related to a
single card or task has been stored in Joplin.

### Issues with system

<div class="caption">I love emacs and org mode... but it really isn't an option
on mobile OSes</div>

- **Have to setup everything on every device**:
- **Emacs wasn't available on mobile devices**:
- **Couldn't share items across systems**: (ex: linking to a note from a task card)**:

### Desires

<div class="caption">Joplin Notes</div>

- Consolidate to one system
- Cross platform (mobile too)
- Kanban board support
- ... BUT normal notes too
- Easy to jump in, add a log note, and get out

## Notion

<div class="caption">Notion window in macOS, displaying my page for this page. The UI looks the same on the web and in my 'Nativfier' app in Linux.</div>

### What I like so far
- FLEXIBLE

<div class="caption">Easy logging using `@now`</div>
- Easy logging using `@now` (like I had in org-mode)
*Picture of Notion - Database (list + Dashboard views?)*
- Databases
    - Multiple views of same data
    - Linkable
- Templates

<div class="caption">Notion views in iOS. Navigation, my 'Areas' card views,
daily log page properties, and a task 'board' view.</div>


- Have it on all my devices, or online
- Free trial, and affordable for pro -- updated. Free for personal :)

### Downsides/Concerns

*Picture of Notion -- Something confusing?, or maybe export options*

- All my eggs in one basket/not open or hosted (but neither was trello)
- Can take a bit of time to learn how to best use it (but hey, I'm coming
    mostly from emacs XD )
- Cost for pro (that could raise in price) (but technically was trello, I just
    didn't think it was worth it since it only did part of what I needed. Also,
    my hosting for joplin notes was being provided by a service I pay for
    [fastmail], which I happened to already use for something else.)
- No command-line client (Honestly for this type of system, it's less and less
    important for me, especially if there is a webapp. I tend to not run my
    laptops without xorg or a windowing system anymore.
