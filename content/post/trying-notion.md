The past year or two has been a whirlwind of trying various notes and planning
systems. I started by attempting to switch everything to [joplin
notes](/post/switched-to-joplin-notes/) only to switch [back to org-mode for my
work notes](/post/back-on-org-mode-for-work/) a few months later. Around that
same time, I also started using [trello](https://trello.com) to organize my
personal and home life into task boards. This system worked well, but felt very
disjointed, spreading my notes, goals, and tasks all over the place. However, that all might
be able to change, as I've started using [Notion](https://notion.so).

## Quick History


### Previous System

<a href="/img/posts/trying-notion/trello_weekly_board.png">
<img alt="Trello Weekly Board" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/trello_weekly_board.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My Trello Weekly Task Board</div>

- Trello for planning weekly tasks/longer term goals, habit tracking
- Emacs org-mode for the same things as trello but specifically for my work
    tasks/log
- Joplin for both my personal and work collection of notes.

### Issues with system

<a href="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/scrum-board.png">
<img alt="Joplin Android GUI" src="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/scrum-board.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">I love emacs and org mode... but it really isn't an option
on mobile OSes</div>

- Have to setup everything on every device
- Emacs wasn't available on mobile devices
- Couldn't share items across systems (ex: linking to a note from a task card)

### Desires

<a href="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/joplin-gui.png">
<img alt="Joplin GUI" src="/img/posts/back-on-org-mode-for-work/joplin-gui.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Joplin Notes</div>

- Consolidate to one system
- Cross platform (mobile too)
- Kanban board support
- ... BUT normal notes too
- Easy to jump in, add a log note, and get out

## Notion

<div class="caption">Notion window in macOS, displaying my page for this page. The UI looks the same on the web and in my 'Nativfier' app in Linux.</div>

### What I like so far
- FLEXIBLE
<a href="/img/posts/trying-notion/now_timestamp.png">
<img alt="logging using @now" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/now_timestamp.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Easy logging using `@now`</div>
- Easy logging using `@now` (like I had in org-mode)
*Picture of Notion - Database (list + Dashboard views?)*
- Databases
    - Multiple views of same data
    - Linkable
- Templates



<a href="/img/posts/trying-notion/ios_notion.png">
<img alt="Notion in iOS" src="/img/posts/trying-notion/ios_notion.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Notion views in iOS. Navigation, my 'Areas' card views,
daily log page properties, and a task 'board' view.</div>


- Have it on all my devices, or online
- Free trial, and affordable for pro -- updated. Free for personal :)

### Downsides/Concerns

*Picture of Notion -- Something confusing?, or maybe export options*

- All my eggs in one basket/not open or hosted (but neither was trello)
- Can take a bit of time to learn how to best use it (but hey, I'm coming
    mostly from emacs XD )
- Cost for pro (that could raise in price) (but technically was trello, I just
    didn't think it was worth it since it only did part of what I needed. Also,
    my hosting for joplin notes was being provided by a service I pay for
    [fastmail], which I happened to already use for something else.)
- No command-line client (Honestly for this type of system, it's less and less
    important for me, especially if there is a webapp. I tend to not run my
    laptops without xorg or a windowing system anymore.
