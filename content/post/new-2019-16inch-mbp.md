In the [previous post about my macOS challange](/post/macos-challenge/), I
mentioned that I purchased the base model of a new 2019 16" Macbook Pro. While
I have had it for over a month, I did take notes on some of my initial thoughts
of my first macbook. Here are those thoughts.

But first, *a word from our sponsor!...* Just kidding. Lets talk about my
selection of macbook.

While completing the macOS challenge, I decided I wanted to buy a
macbook for personal use. However, I had to hold out and wait to hear if the
rumors of a new macbook pro with a scissor switch keyboard were true... or if I
should be considering a used 2015 Macbook on eBay. Fortunately, the rumor
turned to fact, and Apple released the new 16" Macbook Pro. This news coupled
with a great $300 off post-US-Thanksgiving deal, meant that I had a new macbook
shipping to me the first week of December.


#### The Base Model Specs

I chose the base-spec MBP (the cheapest one) for several reasons. First, it
saved me a ton of money because 1) Apple upgrades tend to be expensive, and 2)
pre-spec'd models can be found on sale.

Additionally, the base model specs were increased to include 16 GB and RAM, and
a 512GB SSD, so it already had everything I would normally *need* to upgrade.
The specs of the macbook I got:

```
- 2.6 GHz (4.5 GHz Turbo Boost) 6-Core (12 thread) i7 CPU
- 16 GB 2666MHz DDR4 RAM
- 512 GB SSD
- 16" "Retina" display w/ True Tone
- New Keyboard design, with touchbar and Touch ID
- Four Thunderbold 3 ports
- Headphone Jack
- New speakers and mic
- Silver
```

In a perfect world, I might spring for 32 GB of RAM, but if I think it over, I
*mostly* need RAM to run clusters of VMs... which I stil do on Linux
workstation/servers... not on my laptop.

- **Keyboard** - Well, I‚Äôm surprised. I actually think I really like it. The
first few minutes were a little weird because I was used to the MacBook Air,
and had been using my HHKB all day so far. But after using it for about an hour
now, I think it feels close enough like the air (which I like btw) with enough
travel. It doesn‚Äôt have as much travel as my think pads, but they keys kinda
‚Äúpop‚Äù as I type them and have a very satisfying actuation which I actually
REALLY like. As long as thing thing proves to be sturdy, I‚Äôd say this is
actually a great keyboard I am very happy with :).


- **Trackpad** - Little weird at first (had trouble sliding my finger across.
Needed to oil it up I guess lol), but now it seems to be working well. Getting
used to what I think are fake clicks compared to the actual clicks or the air
too I think‚Ä¶


- **Screen** - It‚Äôs nice. It‚Äôs big and bright and the colors look great. Using
the default scaling still, but actually think it‚Äôs big enough I could probably
move up to the more space one if I needed to and be completely fine.


- **Touch Bar** - Meh. Its whatever. I‚Äôve already installed better touch tool
üòÇ. I‚Äôll play with that later to figure out how I can switch the
audio/brightness to buttons instead of slides (the main thing I don‚Äôt like so
far), and maybe add weather which I thought was cool.


- **Speakers** - I only listen to part of a song so far really (Rory) but‚Ä¶
amazing. Simple as that.


- **Ports** - Just charging so far, so easy enough (side note, the power brick
is solid like a brick. Kinda surprised by that. I‚Äôll have to wait till my
dongle is delivered tomorrow to better comment on this.


- **Performance** - Okay‚Ä¶ maybe brew isn‚Äôt that terrible‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs runs a bit
faster on here compared to the MacBook Air.

<div class="caption">As for ports, the 16" Macbook Pro has two USB C/Thunderbolt3 ports and a headphone jack on one side (pictured), and 2 more USB C/Thunderbolt3 ports on the other side.</div>
</center>

- **Heat** - As I‚Äôm typing this, I do notice the metal at the top of the laptop
(above the Touch Bar) is getting quite warm. In fact, the keys on the number
row are even getting a bit warm. I understand that this is likely where the
heat is exhausted, and probably relies on the aluminum body a bit too as a heat
sink‚Ä¶ but just hope it‚Äôs normal. I should also note that this heat up while I
was installing Xcode which seems to be a beast. It‚Äôs deff cooling down a bit
now that that‚Äôs done, and the entire time down by the palm rest the keyboard
remained nice and cool. Still, something to take note of. Also, the fans never
kicked on for this.


- **Ports/Adaptor Annoyances** - While I‚Äôm not as ‚ÄúWHERE‚ÄôS THE SD CARD READER‚Äù
as everyone else is, and I do generally think the TB ports are a good idea
because assuming the correct dongles are out there, it allows people to
basically mix and match the IO they actually need‚Ä¶ and the TB connections have
enough bandwidth to manage it.

    For example, I don‚Äôt need an SD card ready all that much (unless I‚Äôm playing
with PIs I guess). However, I do need a USB3 and a newish port for my monitor
connection. So I can get something that fits that need. Someone else that needs
a card reader, can get that.

    The issue however is‚Ä¶ there needs to be a bunch of adaptors out there that just
always work with what they advertise, which isn‚Äôt the case. The first one I
tried had issues. Hopefully the second one will work better‚Ä¶ but being TB3 is
not cheap. Which brings up annoyance #2 with this‚Ä¶ it kinda sucks that I
basically have to get an adaptor to use stuff outside the immediate laptop off
the bat. If you already have them, it‚Äôs not big deal as it‚Äôs actually more
standardized then. However, if you don‚Äôt have TB/USBc setup already, it can be
an annoying big up front cost to an already costly purchase.


- **Wrists Rest** - While I really enjoy the solid feel of the aluminum my hands rest on (and how it tends to stay cool down there, even when the computer is heating up), the sharp edge of the laptop cuts into my wrist over time. I love how the hard edge looks, but it does get real uncomfortable over time if I‚Äôm typing a lot. It should be noted however this is something that I have experience on other laptops too. For example, I think even my Bonobo had this issue, even though it had padding on the wrists. It‚Äôs the edges that get me.
