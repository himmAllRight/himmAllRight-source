In the [previous post about my macOS challange](/post/macos-challenge/), I
mentioned that I purchased the base model of a new 2019 16" Macbook Pro. While
I have had it for over a month, I did take notes on some of my initial thoughts
of my first macbook. Here are those thoughts.

But first, *a word from our sponsor!...* Just kidding. Lets talk about my
selection of macbook.

While completing the macOS challenge, I decided I wanted to buy a
macbook for personal use. However, I had to hold out and wait to hear if the
rumors of a new macbook pro with a scissor switch keyboard were true... or if I
should be considering a used 2015 Macbook on eBay. Fortunately, the rumor
turned to fact, and Apple released the new 16" Macbook Pro. This news coupled
with a great $300 off post-US-Thanksgiving deal, meant that I had a new macbook
shipping to me the first week of December.


#### The Base Model Specs

I chose the base-spec MBP (the cheapest one) for several reasons. First, it
saved me a ton of money because 1) Apple upgrades tend to be expensive, and 2)
pre-spec'd models can be found on sale.

Additionally, the base model specs were increased to include 16 GB and RAM, and
a 512GB SSD, so it already had everything I would normally *need* to upgrade.
The specs of the macbook I got:

```
- 2.6 GHz (4.5 GHz Turbo Boost) 6-Core (12 thread) i7 CPU
- 16 GB 2666MHz DDR4 RAM
- 512 GB SSD
- 16" "Retina" display w/ True Tone
- New Keyboard design, with touchbar and Touch ID
- Four Thunderbold 3 ports
- Headphone Jack
- New speakers and mic
- Silver
```

In a perfect world, I might spring for 32 GB of RAM, but if I think it over, I
*mostly* need RAM to run clusters of VMs... which I stil do on Linux
workstation/servers... not on my laptop.
