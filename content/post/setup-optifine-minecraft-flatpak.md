Over the last couple of months I have started playing Minecraft (Java) on my
desktop again. With my [graphics card update](), I wanted to start using some
shaders. Nothing fancy, but something to bring the game up to the next level.
However, unlike when I was in college, these days I can install and play
minecraft using a [flatpak](). This makes it convienient to install, but can
make figuring out how to install something like mods or Optifine a bit more
complicated. So here's how to do it.

*Note: Beforea we start, I have only done this on Fedora Linux. It is possible
that paths and locations may differ on other distros*.


### Install Minecraft Flatpak

*Image of Minecraft Launcher?*

First, if minecraft isn't already installed as a flatpak, lets do that first.
Make sure [flathub is enabled]() and then run the following command to install
Minecraft:

```bash
flatpak install com.mojang.Minecraft
```

Open up the launcher, and login to verify that everything is working.
