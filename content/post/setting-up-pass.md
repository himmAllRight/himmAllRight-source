I've been using `pass` for several years now to manage my passwords. I used to have issues setting
it up on a new machine, but those days appear to be ove. It is a simple, but flexible system.
Here's how to get started.

## My Password Manager History

For the longest time... I didn't use a password manager (but in my defence, not
many people did). Then in college, I started using
[lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/). It was simple and made it easy for me to
switch all my passwords to randomly generated ones. It even allowed me to
configure my [yubikey](https://www.yubico.com) with it. It was a good system
and worked for years.

Then, in 2015, Lastpass was acquired by [LogMeIn](https://www.logmeininc.com),
which had a questionable past of Linux support. Like many others in the open
source community... I started looking for alternatives. I had already started
to keep my eyes opened for a replacement even before the acquisition because
there was one big issue I had with LastPass... it largely worked as a Chrome or
Firefox plugin. As someone who occasionally uses other browsers like
[qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org), or works on headless machines, I try
not to use applications that exist solely as a FireFox/Chome app.
Additionally... I'm not a fan of web-apps.

So, as I watched others switch their password manager, I watched Chris Fischer
of the Linux Action Show, switch to
[pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfgZ5Fh-NfE&feature=youtu.be&t=4935).
While I don't think he kept with the system long term... I did.
