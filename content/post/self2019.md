## SELF

***Picture of Badge***

Easy drive for me. Got there and checked in. I liked the badge design :).


## Talks
### Building your own Cloud - Amolith

Started our by giving an overview of registering a domain name, getting a VPS
(and even touched on watching out for sever/company location and how their
privacy laws can affect you). He then showed a nice list of different services
and that can be self hosted.

Next, he started walking through setting up a server with server setups. People
gave feedback as he progressed and well all learned a bit from that. For
exammple, when creating ssh keys, you can use the `-a` flag and it will help
make it *much* more secure.
