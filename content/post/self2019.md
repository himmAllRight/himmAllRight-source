The last few years, I have watched the South East Linux Fest from a distance,
often via listreams run by [Jupiter
Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) and/or the [Ask Noah
Show](http://www.asknoahshow.com/). Last year, I decided that I would make the
effort to fly down for SELF 2018... and then we ended up moving from MA to NC
the same weekend as SELF. This year, being only two hours away, I decided there
was no excuse, so I went. It was just a day-trip.... but I went. Here's a quick
summary.

## SELF

***Picture of Badge***

Easy drive for me. Got there and checked in. I liked the badge design :).


## Talks

Just summarize from all talks, and what I liked/learned.

- In-talk feedback was great. Comforting to new presenters.
