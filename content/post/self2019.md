The last few years, I have watched the South East Linux Fest from a distance,
often via listreams run by [Jupiter
Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) and/or the [Ask Noah
Show](http://www.asknoahshow.com/). Last year, I decided that I would make the
effort to fly down for SELF 2018... and then we ended up moving from MA to NC
the same weekend as SELF. This year, being only two hours away, I decided there
was no excuse, so I went. It was just a day-trip.... but I went. Here's a quick
summary.

## SELF

I finialized my plans to actually attend SELF sort of last minute, about two
weeks ago. I convinced one of my friends from work to attend with me over lunch
and we registered right after. So, this past Saturday morning we left Durham
around 6:30 am for the 2-ish hour drive to Charlotte.

When we got to the hotel and parked the car, we weren't entirely sure where to
go. Then, we noticed a person walking toward a door carrying a old mechanical
keyboard under their arm... Probably a good lead. Sure enough, after following
them through the door, we found ourselves in the middle of the hallway booths,
face-to-face with a ["RUN GCC"
T-shirt](https://shop.fsf.org/tshirts-hoodies/run-gcc-shirt). We found it.

After walking around a bit, we worked our way to registration and got our
badges. It was a little booklet on a lanyard that contained information and the
event schedule. However, it *did* confuse me at first because the one side was
upside-down compared to the other side... but then I realized it was so it
could function as a name-tag, but still be *easily* read while still around
one's neck.



## Talks

Throughout the day, I went to several talks on with ranging from building
personal clouds, 3D printers, security compliance testing, network backups, and
even building a tiny house. The talks were generally good, and I left with a
bunch of notes on topics and software I might want to dig into at some point.
For example, I think it might be useful to look into [chef
inspec](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-inspec/), or at least similar
alternatives to it, for verifying testing environments at work.


The biggest take-away I got from the talks at SELF wasn't the *content* of the
talks, but rather the environment they were presented in. Overall, it seemed
like a very knowledgeable but supportive audience.


For example, one of the
speakers was a bit nervous as it was his first time giving a talk. The rather
full room responded with *"don't worry, you're doing great! This is how you
learn"*. Then, the live demo, experienced some ... *issues* (as they tend to
do). The audiance responded by laughing *with* the speaker and calling out
statements like "That always happens to me! See, you're one of us!". People
also started discussing tips and tricks they've learned over the years. The
room was able to take what *could* have been a *disaster* for the speaker, and
turn it into an engaging experience where *everyone* in the room connected and
learned from on another. As a result, a "*failed*" talk ended up being an even
*better* experience than if everything went perfectly (which it *never* does).

## Thoughts

All in all, I think SELF was a good example of what the Linux and Open Source
community can be when at their best. Did I encounter people I disagreed with,
or throught were a bit too abrasive? You bet. Did it ultimately matter? Not
really. Even when we disagree, if we can muster up the maturity to still *work
together*, we can still learn and grow even when everything is going wrong.
Just like in the talk I sat in.

Overall, I enjoyed SELF even though I am fully aware that I "did SELF wrong" by
only going for one day and mostly watching the talks. I didn't spend too much
time in the "[hallway
track](https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/2018/05/15/hallway-track-open-source-conferences/)",
and missed out on the late-night antics and philosophical discussions I heard
about. But I still learned a bunch and enjoyed myself. Now that I've scoped out
SELF, in the future I think I plan to stay for the whole event... and maybe
even submit a talk. See you there!
