The past few years I have watched the South East Linux Fest (SELF) from a
distance, often via listreams run by [Jupiter
Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) and/or the [Ask Noah
Show](http://www.asknoahshow.com/). Last year, I decided to finally travel to
Charlotte for SELF 2018. While my wife and I *did* drive down to North Carolina
that weekend, it was instead to Durham... with a moving truck. This year, being
only two hours away, I decided there was no excuse. I did a day-trip....  but I
went. I'm glad I did.

## SELF

I finalized my plans to attend SELF last minute, about two weeks ago. I
convinced a friend from work to attend with me one day over lunch, and we
registered right after. So, this past Saturday morning we left Durham around
6:30 am for the 2-ish hour drive to Charlotte.

When we got to the hotel parkng lot, we weren't entirely sure where to go.
Then, we noticed a person walking towards a door carrying a old mechanical
keyboard under their arm... a clue. Sure enough, after following that person
through the same door, we found ourselves in the middle of a hallway filled
with Linux booths and face-to-face with a ["RUN GCC"
T-shirt](https://shop.fsf.org/tshirts-hoodies/run-gcc-shirt) on display. We
found SELF.

After walking around a bit, we worked our way to registration and received our
badges. They were little booklets on a lanyard that contained event information and the
schedule. However, it *did* confuse me at first because the one side was
upside-down compared to the other side... but then I realized it was so it
could function as a name-tag, but still be *easily* read while still around
one's neck. Very practical.



## Talks

Throughout the day, I went to several talks with an array of topics, including building
personal clouds, 3D printers, security compliance testing, network backups, and
even building a tiny house. The talks were generally interesting, and I left with a
bunch of notes on topics and software I might want to dig into at some point.
For example, I think it might be useful to look into [chef
inspec](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-inspec/) (or at least similar
alternatives to it), for verifying build/test environments at work.


The biggest lesson I learned from the talks at SELF wasn't from their
*content*, but rather the *environment* they were presented in. Overall, it
seemed like a very knowledgeable, but supportive audience.


For example, one of the speakers was a little flustered as it was his first time
giving a talk. When the speaker stated he was a bit nervous, the room responded
with *"don't worry, you're doing great so far! This is how you learn"*. Then...
the live demo experienced some issues (as they tend to do). The audience
responded by laughing *with* the speaker and shouting out statements like "That
always happens to me! See, you *are* one of us!". People then started
discussing related tips and tricks they've learned over the years, while we
*all* worked to troubleshoot the demo.

The room was able to take what *could* have been a disaster for the speaker,
and turn it into an engaging experience where *everyone* in the room connected
and learned from one another.  As a result, a "*failed*" talk ended up being a
*better* experience than originally planned.

I think SELF displayed glimmers of what the Linux and Open Source
community *can be* when at their best. Did I encounter people I disagreed with,
or thought were a bit too abrasive? You bet. Did it ultimately matter? Not
really. When we disagree, if we can muster up the maturity to *work
together*, we will learn and grow as a community, even when everything is going wrong.
Just like in the talk I described above.
`</soapbox>`

I am fully aware that I "did SELF wrong" by only going for
a single day and mostly watching talks. I didn't spend too much
time in the "[hallway
track](https://web.archive.org/web/20201129232611/https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource/2018/05/15/hallway-track-open-source-conferences/)",
and missed out on the late-night antics and philosophical discussions I heard
about. Regardless, I still learned a bunch and had a great time. Now that I've scoped out
SELF, in the future I think I plan to stay for the whole event... and maybe
even submit a talk. See you there!
