## SELF

***Picture of Badge***

Easy drive for me. Got there and checked in. I liked the badge design :).


## Talks
### Building your own Cloud - Amolith

Started our by giving an overview of registering a domain name, getting a VPS
(and even touched on watching out for sever/company location and how their
privacy laws can affect you). He then showed a nice list of different services
and that can be self hosted.

Next, he started walking through setting up a server with server setups. People
gave feedback as he progressed and well all learned a bit from that. For
exammple, when creating ssh keys, you can use the `-a` flag and it will help
make it *much* more secure.

Then went through explaining how to install some stuff like nginx, nodejs, and
others.

Stuff went wrong, but we all had fun trying to figure it out.

### 3D Printers: Commodities or Toys for Enthusiasts? - Charles Bell, PhD

Speaker was well versed and has written books on 3D printers. Gave backgrounds
with 3D printing and well organized talk about the state and background of 3D
printers.

Went through the main types available today and was overall a good introduction
for something which I am *curious* about, but know absolutely *nothing* about.

Walked through buying used printers, what to look for when getting one, and
which ones a good to get used.
