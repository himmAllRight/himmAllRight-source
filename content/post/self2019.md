The last few years, I have watched the South East Linux Fest from a distance,
often via listreams run by [Jupiter
Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) and/or the [Ask Noah
Show](http://www.asknoahshow.com/). Last year, I decided that I would make the
effort to fly down for SELF 2018... and then we ended up moving from MA to NC
the same weekend as SELF. This year, being only two hours away, I decided there
was no excuse, so I went. It was just a day-trip.... but I went. Here's a quick
summary.

## SELF

I finialized my plans to actually attend SELF sort of last minute, about two
weeks ago. I convinced one of my friends from work to attend with me over lunch
and we registered right after. So, this past Saturday morning we left Durham
around 6:30 am for the 2-ish hour drive to Charlotte.

When we got to the hotel and parked the car, we weren't entirely sure where to
go. Then, we noticed a person walking toward a door carrying a old mechanical
keyboard under their arm... Probably a good lead. Sure enough, after following
them through the door, we found ourselves in the middle of the hallway booths,
face-to-face with a ["RUN GCC"
T-shirt](https://shop.fsf.org/tshirts-hoodies/run-gcc-shirt). We found it.

After walking around a bit, we worked our way to registration and got our
badges. It was a little booklet on a lanyard that contained information and the
event schedule. However, it *did* confuse me at first because the one side was
upside-down compared to the other side... but then I realized it was so it
could function as a name-tag, but still be *easily* read while still around
one's neck.



## Talks

Just summarize from all talks, and what I liked/learned.

- In-talk feedback was great. Comforting to new presenters.
