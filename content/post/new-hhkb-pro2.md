After years of using a Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite, I have *finally* pulled the trigger and splurged on a Happy Hacking Professional 2 keyboard. And I love it.

## My history with the HHKB Lite

## Time for a Mechanical Keyboard
After years of using the standard rubber dome HHKB lite, I wanted to finally switch to a true mechanical keyboard. I searched long and hard, looking at all different layouts, and learning about the various switch types, mostly [cherry MX switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_(keyboards)). After purchasing and playing with a [switch tester](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1620), I confirmed that I would likely enjoy MX clear switches best. They are quiet enough I could still reasonabily use them in an office, but still had the nice tactile bump that I love (more than what I experienced on the Browns). Additionally, I knew that I wanted to stick with a small, minimalistic layout that I had grown to love, so I exclusively looked at [60% keyboards](https://deskthority.net/wiki/60%25), with the occasional [40%](https://deskthority.net/wiki/40%25) board catching my eye.

Like many, I eventually landed at the [Vortex Pok3r](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Vortex_Pok3r). It beautiful, minimal, but sturdy appearance, and had a MX clear variant. I had made my decision, but at the time, new boards weren't available so I decided I would sit back and wait a little while to see if it would drop on [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/). I had waited years to purchase a mechanical keyboard, I could wait a little longer to get the one I wanted.

## The Planck Drop

While I was waiting for a Pok3r drop... something interesting caught my eye on Massdrop... the [Plack keyboard](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard) dropped... The planck is a keyboard kit that you solder together to create a programmable, *ortholinear*, 40% keyboard. When I say *programmable*, I don't just mean you can bind keys. The Planck is fully open and the firmware C code is available on Github. So, you can actually customize and hack together the firmware, which was very appealing to me. So I joined the drop.

After I joined the drop, I purchased a soldering kit so that I could construct the keyboard once it finally shipped. However, the planck drop had *several* delays, but as I previously stated, I didn't mind too much and was willing to wait. The planck got delayed *so* much, that they eventually allowed people to cancel their order and recieve a refund. I thought the order cancelation was something you *opted in* to do, but it was actually an *opt out* situation... so my lack of response had my order cancled, pre-maturely ending my planck experience.

## Deciding on the HHKB Pro

With my planck order cancelled, and a refund imminent, I started to look at other options again. The main contender was still the Pok3r. I started researching it again and learning about how I could program the layers to have a layout I would like... and eventually realized I just kept re-creating the infamous HHKB layout. 

So I started to consider the HHKB again. My main reasons for not getting it origonally was that it is a good bit more expensive than the majority of mechanical keyboards on the market. However, after waiting months for the planck, and noticing I kept comparing everything to the HHKB, I realized I would eventually end up with an HHKB anyway, and decided to just go for it now. Decision made.

## Getting the HHKB

Once I decided on the HHKB, and obtained approval from my wife ( ;) ), I purchased it from Amazon. The one 

## What I like
