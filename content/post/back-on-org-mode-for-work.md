## Home vs Work Notes
### Home

### Work


## Use Cases
### Joplin Use cases
#### "Notes"-Style
#### Shared across Computer and Mobile Devices
#### Simple Markdown Format -- Sharable
#### Various topics which don't pile up a ton over time

### Org-mode use cases
#### Logging-Style Notes
#### Quick Notes, Keybinds
#### Todo/SCRUM Board tasks
#### Exporting/Archiving Weekly Logs


### Future Plans
