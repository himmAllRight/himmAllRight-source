Last month, I wrote about my [switch to Joplin](post/switched-to-joplin-notes/)
for my personal and work notes. While there were many features I liked about
the system, I had a few issues which caused concern for using the application
long-term for all my notes. While I am still using Joplin for all of my
personal notes, I have switched back to `org-mode` for my notes at work. Why
have I switched at work, but *not* at home?

## Use Cases
To better understand why Joplin works well for me at home but not work, lets
first the different features between Joplin and emacs org-mode.

### Joplin Features
#### "Notes"-Style

<div class="caption">Joplin uses a traditional "note" layout, with blank text
boxes organized into notebooks.</div>

Joplin organizes notes in a traditional "notes" style. Each note starts as a
big, blank text-box that the user fills in. These notes are further organized
into "notebooks", which is simply a list of one or notes. While the notes are written
in markdown, which allows the user format them in any way, the system doesn't
really support features like collapsible sections or outlines.

#### Simple Markdown Format -- Sharable
The markdown editor in Joplin may not support collapsing sections, but it does
a great job at supporting other features, like simple code highlighting and web
links. Additionaly, being markdown the contents can be easily exported,
transferred, or even shared with other applications and/or people. This is
handy when grabbing snippets from the web, which may already be in a markdown
friendly format.

#### Shared across Computer and Mobile Devices

<div class="caption">The Notebook and Notes views on the Android client.</div>

Lastly, the Joplin application is available on all platforms, including mobile.
Furthermore, it syncs the notes across all devices. This makes it easy to take
write some notes at a computer, and then have available on a phone while
traveling.

### Org-mode use cases
#### Logging-Style Notes
#### Quick Notes, Keybinds
#### Todo/SCRUM Board tasks
#### Exporting/Archiving Weekly Logs


## Home vs Work Notes
### Home Use Case
#### Various topics which don't pile up a ton over time


### Work Use Case



### Future Plans
