At the beginning of summer, I was thinking maybe we should improve my wife's setup with
a new external monitor. She agreed. So, over the last few weeks, we have
purchased, recieved, and even _mounted_, the [LG 32QK500w](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-32QK500-W-led-monitor)
monitor. Here are my thoughts.

### Reasoning
Recently, my wife has had to study/prep at night for her next workday, which
she does on her laptop. So we decided it was a good time to finally setup her
office space in the guest bedroom. She has an old 21.5" 1080p monitor from
college, but talking it over we decided it might not be the best fit for the
space.

We decided that it would be nice to have a larger screen in that room which guests
could watch content on. Additionally, we have a habit of falling asleep
watching TV on the couch most weekend nights. So, while we want to keep a TV
out of our bedroom, having a spot where we can lay down on a bed and prep for
the inevitable is probably a good idea (our backs agree).

So I started looking for slightly larger monitors and noticed something... the
2560x1440 32" monitors were a good bit cheaper than their 27" counterparts.This
makes sense as the dpi is lower, but doing the math, 2560x1440 pixels @ 32" is
the same dpi of as a 24" 1920x1080 monitor, about 109 dots per inch. While this
isn't the most _crisp_, it is very common and reasonable for productivity setups.

<div class="caption">2560x1440 pixels at 32" has a dpi of 91</div>

<a href="/img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-24.png">
<img alt="1920 by 1080 pixels at 24 inches also has a dpi of 91." src="/img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-24.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">1920x1080 pixels at 24" also has a dpi of 91</div>


Additionally, my wife doesn't have the best vision (especially at night when
she tends to work), so the larger scale of a 109 dpi is actually _preferred_
(we purposefully picked the 1600x900 resolution screen over the FHD one when
buying her Thinkpad for the same reason).

Lastly, while scaled a little larger on a bigger display, it is still a
2560x1440 resolution. I have recently declared this the best for productivity
(at least in the type of workflows I use), and even figured out how to
[configure a 2560x1440 "sub-monitor" on my 43" QHD
monitor](http://192.168.1.5:1313/post/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/) when
I need to _focus_. With this monitor, I am also comfortable to sit down and
dock my computer to it when I want to focus and mix things up a bit.


### Selection
So, I wanted a 32", 2560x1440 IPS monitor... at a decent price.

### What I Like

- Resolution

- Colors

- 75 Hz refresh rate (and Freesync!)

### What I Don't Like

- No speakers/audio plug isn't great

- While dpi is perfect for it's use, it isn't the best

- White back?
