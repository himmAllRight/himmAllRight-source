At the beginning of summer, I was entertaining the idea of improving my wife's
computer setup by adding a new external monitor. She agreed. As a result, we
have purchased, recieved, and even _mounted_, the [LG
32QK500w](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-32QK500-W-led-monitor) monitor.
Here are my thoughts.

### Reasoning
Recently, my wife has had to spend more time prepping at night for her next workday, which
she does on her laptop. This made it a good time to finally setup her
office space in the guest bedroom. She has an old 21.5" 1080p monitor from
college, but we decided it might not be the best fit for the
space.

We thought that it would be nice to have a larger screen in that room, guests
could watch video content. Additionally, my wife and I have a habit of falling
asleep on the couch watching TV most weekend nights... but we want to keep our
bedroom TV free. Having a spot where we can lay down on a bed and prep for the
inevitable while watching a movie, is probably a good idea (and our backs agree).

I started looking for slightly larger monitors and quickly noticed something... the
2560x1440 32" monitors were cheaper than their 27" counterparts. This
made sense, as the dpi is lower. However, after doing the math, 2560x1440 pixels @ 32" is
the same dpi of as a 24" 1920x1080 monitor (109 dots per inch). While this
isn't the _sharpest_ configuration, it is very common and reasonable for productivity setups.

<div class="caption">2560x1440 pixels at 32" has a dpi of 91</div>

<a href="/img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-24.png">
<img alt="1920 by 1080 pixels at 24 inches also has a dpi of 91." src="/img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-24.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">1920x1080 pixels at 24" also has a dpi of 91</div>


In fact, my wife doesn't have the best vision (especially at night when she
tends to work), and tends to actually _prefer_ the larger scale of 109 dpi. We
even purposefully picked a 1600x900 resolution screen over a FHD one when
buying her Thinkpad for the same reason.

Lastly, while it is scaled up a bit on a physically larger display, these
monitors still provide a 2560x1440 resolution. Recently, I have decided that
this particular resolution, may be the best for productivity , at least in the
type of workflows I use. I even figured out how to [configure a 2560x1440
"sub-monitor" on my 43" QHD monitor](/post/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/)
when I need to _focus_. Having an _actual_ 2560x1440 monitor in the house would
be wonderful for both my wife's and my own productivity.

So I wanted a 32", 2560x1440 IPS monitor... at a decent price. After browsing
around amazon, I came across the [LG
32QK500W](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LD6XJ8X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
It was listed at a very reasonable price (on sale), had a few bonus features
(75 Hz refresh + freesync options), and was an LG IPS panel, which I felt
comfortable purchasing considering how much I enjoyed [my LG
monitor's](/post/new-lgud4379b/) panel.

In summary, the LG 32QK500-W has the following specs/features:

* 32 inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution
* IPS Panel
* mDP and 2 HDMI imports
* VESA mount compatible
* Decently thin bezels
* 60 *and* 75 Hertz refresh rates
* Freesync
* On sale for less than $250 (USD)


We also purchased a cheap [Amazon basics
mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BCUM766/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
to wall mount it, but in hindsight it might of been worth paying a little
extra for a better one.

### What I Like

#### Resolution
<a href="/img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/screenshot.png">
<img alt="Screenshot of working on monitor" src="/img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/screenshot.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The resolution is perfect for productivity work.</div>

The "2k" resolution is perfect. It gives just enough space to get work done,
but not *so* much space that it is distracting. I can perfectly fit two *full*
windows next to each other on the screen. At the same time, it is still a small
enough resolution that a single focused full screen window doesn't look odd.

#### Colors
The colors look great. They are vivid, and the blacks are *dark*.
I think I may even enjoy them better than on my own monitor...

#### 75 Hz refresh rate (and Freesync!)
Lastly, the 75 Hz refresh rate and Freesync was a nice little bonus. While the
only computer we have in the house that can *really* take advantage of these
features is [my desktop](/post/charmeleon-desktop-design/) (which is in another
room)...  it's nice to know we have the option if I want to test it out.

### What I Don't Like

#### No speakers... and audio jack is noisy
Normally, I could care less if a monitor has speakers or not. They usually
sound terrible, and I end up plugging external headphones/speakers to the
computer directly anyway. However, as we intend to also use this monitor as a
"TV" via an [Amazon
Firestick](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=amazon+fire+stick&qid=1563791000&s=gateway&sr=8-1),
it would be nice to have even _basic_ speakers to pump audio through by
default. It _does_ have a 3.5mm headphone jack, but there seemed to be a bit of
noise when I tried it.

#### While dpi is perfect for it's use, it isn't the best
As mentioned earlier, the dpi isn't the best, and the image isn't quite as
"crisp" as you might find on a high resolution display. Also, at such a large
screen size, it is almost required to sit back from the screen a little bit
further than normal. However, as I already described in the sections above...
for our use case, this was actually preferred.

### Conclusion

There isn't much left to say. At this price point, and for what we wanted this
monitor for, I think it was a perfect match. While it might not be the absolute
*best* monitor out there, it is a great value. If you're looking for a large
1440p monitor to get some work done on, that could also be a TV replacement at
a good price (I'm looking at you college students), I highly recommend it.
