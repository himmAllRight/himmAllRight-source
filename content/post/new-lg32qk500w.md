### Reasoning
- Wanted to setup an external monitor for wife
- Also wanted a screen in guest bedroom (for guests to use, or for us to watch
    movies on)
- I wouldn't mind a 1440p monitor I could alternatively use when working.
- I learned they made 32" 1440p monitors, and their dpi is about the same as a
    24" 1080p (which isn't terrible). The best part... these are cheaper than
    their 27" counterparts.

### Selection
So, I wanted a 32", 2560x1440 IPS monitor... at a decent price.

### What I Like

- Resolution

- Colors

- 75 Hz refresh rate

### What I Don't Like

- No speakers/audio plug isn't great

- While dpi is perfect for it's use, it isn't the best

- White back?


### Conclusion
