At the beginning of summer, I was thinking maybe we should improve my wife's setup with
a new external monitor. She agreed. So, over the last few weeks, we have
purchased, recieved, and even _mounted_, the [LG 32QK500w](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-32QK500-W-led-monitor)
monitor. Here are my thoughts.

### Reasoning
Recently, my wife has had to study/prep at night for her next workday, which
she does on her laptop. So we decided it was a good time to finally setup her
office space in the guest bedroom. She has an old 21.5" 1080p monitor from
college, but talking it over we decided it might not be the best fit for the
space.

We decided that it would be nice to have a larger screen in that room which guests
could watch content on. Additionally, we have a habit of falling asleep
watching TV on the couch most weekend nights. So, while we want to keep a TV
out of our bedroom, having a spot where we can lay down on a bed and prep for
the inevitable is probably a good idea (our backs agree).

So I started looking for slightly larger monitors and noticed something... the
2560x1440 32" monitors were a good bit cheaper than their 27" counterparts.This
makes sense as the dpi is lower, but doing the math, 2560x1440 pixels @ 32" is
the same dpi of as a 24" 1920x1080 monitor, about 109 dots per inch. While this
isn't the most _crisp_, it is very common and reasonable for productivity setups.

<div class="caption">2560x1440 pixels at 32" has a dpi of 91</div>

<a href="/img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-24.png">
<img alt="1920 by 1080 pixels at 24 inches also has a dpi of 91." src="/img/posts/new-lg32qk500w/dpi-24.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">1920x1080 pixels at 24" also has a dpi of 91</div>


Additionally, my wife doesn't have the best vision (especially at night when
she tends to work), so the larger scale of a 109 dpi is actually _preferred_
(we purposefully picked the 1600x900 resolution screen over the FHD one when
buying her Thinkpad for the same reason).

Lastly, while scaled a little larger on a bigger display, it is still a
2560x1440 resolution. I have recently declared this the best for productivity
(at least in the type of workflows I use), and even figured out how to
[configure a 2560x1440 "sub-monitor" on my 43" QHD
monitor](http://192.168.1.5:1313/post/sub-monitor-workflows-with-xrandr/) when
I need to _focus_. With this monitor, I am also comfortable to sit down and
dock my computer to it when I want to focus and mix things up a bit.


### Selection

So, I wanted a 32", 2560x1440 IPS monitor... at a decent price. After browsing
around amazon, I came across the [LG 32QK500W](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LD6XJ8X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It was listed at a very reasonable price, had a few bonus features (75 Hz refresh + freesync options), and was an LG IPS panel, which I felt comfortable purchasing considering how much I enjoyed [my LG monitor](/post/new-lgud4379b/).

In summary, the LG 32QK500-W has the following specs/features:

* 32 Inch 2560 x 1440 pixel
* IPS Panel
* mDP and 2 HDMI imports
* VESA mount capatable
* 60 *and* 75 Hertz refresh rates
* Freesync
* On sale for less than $250 (USD)


We also got a cheap [Amazon basics
mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BCUM766/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
to wall mount it, but in hindsight, it might of been worth paying a little
extra for a better one.

### What I Like

#### Resolution
The "2k" resolution is perfect. It gives just enough space to get work done,
but not *so* much space that it is distracting. I can perfectly
fit two *full* windows next to each other on the screen. At the same time, it
is still a small enough resolution that I can comfortably work with a
focused full screen window.

#### Colors
The colors are great. The are nice and sharp, and the blacks are *really* dark.
I think I might even enjoy them better than on my monitor...

#### 75 Hz refresh rate (and Freesync!)
Lastly, the 75 Hz refresh rate and Freesync was a nice little bonus. While the
only computer we have in the house that can *really* take advantage of that is
[my desktop](/post/charmeleon-desktop-design/), which is in another room...
it's nice to know we have the option if I every want to test it out.

### What I Don't Like

#### No speakers... and audio jack isn't great
Normally, I could care less if a monitor has speakers or not. They usually
sound terrible, and I end up plugging external headphones/speakers to the
computer directly anyway. However, as we intend to also use this monitor as a
"TV" via an [Amazon
Firestick](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=amazon+fire+stick&qid=1563791000&s=gateway&sr=8-1),
it would be nice to have even _basic_ speakers to pump audio through by
default. It _does_ have a 3.5mm headphone jack, but there seemed to be a bit of
noise when I tried it.

#### While dpi is perfect for it's use, it isn't the best
As mentioned earlier, the dpi isn't the best, and the image isn't quite as
"crisp" as you might find on a high resolution display. Also, at such a large
screen size, it is almost required to sit back from the screen a little bit
further than normal. However, as I already described in the sections above...
for our use case, this was actually preferred.

### Conclusion
I think that's it. There isn't much left to say. At this price point, and for
what we wanted a monitor for, I think this was a perfect match. While it might
not be the top of the line, best monitor out there, it is a great value. If
you're looking for a large 1440p monitor to get some work done on, and maybe
watch a TV show or two on for a good price (I'm looking at you college
students), I highly recommend it.
