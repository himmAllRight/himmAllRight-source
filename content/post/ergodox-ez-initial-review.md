*Fixed*, and working on my computer with a fresh install too.


### Some changes I have now



## Getting used to and learning the board

- When I got it I did a fair bit of typing practice
- Within a few days, I was at a passable typing speed, and a few more and I was
    at a decent speed.
- I haven't been doing any typing practice the last few weeks and some of my
    bad habits have crept in.
- I'm not sure if I'm *faster* than on my old keyboard, but it is much more
    pleasent to type on, even when going faster (I could really only *burst*
    speed type on the HHKB because of my poor form).
- I want to start practicing again (Doesn't zsh have a typing trainer? If so
    link here)

## What I like

### Customizeability
Going to break this into two paragraphs, or maybe two sub sections if each
item needs more than a single para

#### Firmware

*Picture of some of my layout options?*

- I've already hinted about the ability to customize the layouts and I have
    done so.
- Tweaking it has slowed down, but even today I realized I wanted a key on one
    of my layers so I popped open the tools, and had the fix in about a minute.
- It sort of reminds me of when I use to use vanilla arch linux. You can go
    weeks and think you have everything installed and then all of sudden, you
    realize your missing a key, or it could be better positioned in the layers.
    - For example, last week while clipping a video, I noticed that I didn't
        think I had a 'delete' key. So I added one. Done.

#### Hardware

*Picture of switch under keycap*

- In addition to the firmware, It's nice to know the extent to what I can
    *physically* change about my keyboard.
- I've looked around at some of the parts I could tweak on my board in a year
    or two if I want to mix things up (without actually getting a different
    board).
- I wouldn't be against possibly swapping to mx clears for example. The main
    issue is the backglow lights shouldn't shine through then...
    - Which isn't that big of an issue though, because many of the alternative
        keycaps I like are solid (link?)
- Despite talking about all the hardware upgrades I can make, I actually like
it's current configuration. I love the board as it is, and am in no rush to
swap everything out. I *love* that I can though.


### Ortholinear


### Split Design

*Picture using ergodox w/ next stand*

Having a split keyboard, specifically one that is completely split, is so nice
from an ergonimic use. I can basically lay my arms on my desk in whichever way
is most comfortable... and move my keyboard to match it.

Additionally, the split design allows it to pair nicely with laptop stands, as
I can have them sit closer to me, which helps with the smaller screen.

### Thumb keys


## What I don't love
There's honestly not I don't *like*, but here is a thing or two that I maybe
don't *love*..

### Brown switches are a bit sensitive?


### Learning curve


### Cost


### It's difficult to switch back to my HHKB...

## Conclusion
