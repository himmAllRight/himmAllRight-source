A few posts ago, I wrote about how I [decided to purchase an ergodox-ez] split
keyboard. However, in that post I omitted all of the juicy details about what
configuration I ordered... as well as what I even *though* about the board, now
that I have been an ergodoc owner for... wow, almost two months now. Okay, I
guess this post is due, here are my '*initial*' thoughts of the ergodox-ez...

<!--more-->


## Ordering and shipping

100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The boxes my ergodox-ez shipped in</div>

So, what ergodox specifically did I order? After much debate and repeatedly changing my
mind, I eventually settled on an ergodox-ez *glow* (backlit keys), with a
black body and black printed (LED Compatible) key caps. With a narrowed
selection of key-cap options (for backlit key compatibility), I landed on
Cherry MX Browns likely being my best option. I knew I wanted a noticable
tactile bump, but didn't want "click-y" keys (I prefer a lower "*Clack*", while
typing and find the higher pitch of MX Blues annoying). I decided that if
I might as well go all in, so I also ordered the tenting poles and the black
wrist rests.

With all of my options decided, I placed my order and prepared myself to wait
in anticipated glee for... an average of 3 weeks shipping time ಠ_ಠ. *Luckily*,
I was fortunate and about a week later, I have a long, flat box show up at my
door.

<div class="caption">Opening the ergodox box</div>

Overall, everything was very well packaged. The keyboard came in one box and
the wrist rests had their own, which matched in width as the big box. Lifting
the lid on the keyboard box, I was greeted by the keyboard looking back at me
through a plastic panel, with it's accessories (cables, key switch pulled,
screws) neatly pinned around it.

## Setup

The initial *physical* setup was quite simple. I took everything out of the
box, connected the two haves of the board together with the included TRRS
cable, and then used the mini usb cable (also included) to connect right half
of the board, to my laptop's usb port. I set down the wrists, rests and acted
tweaked the tenting poles to some arbitrary position, as if I knew what I was
doing. That was it. At that point, I was able to type... *stuff*... into my
computer.

### Initial Layout Changes


### Some issues with Wally

*Fixed*, and working on my computer with a fresh install too.




## Getting used to and learning the board

- When I got it I did a fair bit of typing practice
- Within a few days, I was at a passable typing speed, and a few more and I was
    at a decent speed.
- I haven't been doing any typing practice the last few weeks and some of my
    bad habits have crept in.
- I'm not sure if I'm *faster* than on my old keyboard, but it is much more
    pleasent to type on, even when going faster (I could really only *burst*
    speed type on the HHKB because of my poor form).
- I want to start practicing again (Doesn't zsh have a typing trainer? If so
    link here)

## What I like

### Customizeability
Going to break this into two paragraphs, or maybe two sub sections if each
item needs more than a single para

#### Firmware

*Picture of some of my layout options?*

- I've already hinted about the ability to customize the layouts and I have
    done so.
- Tweaking it has slowed down, but even today I realized I wanted a key on one
    of my layers so I popped open the tools, and had the fix in about a minute.
- It sort of reminds me of when I use to use vanilla arch linux. You can go
    weeks and think you have everything installed and then all of sudden, you
    realize your missing a key, or it could be better positioned in the layers.
    - For example, last week while clipping a video, I noticed that I didn't
        think I had a 'delete' key. So I added one. Done.

#### Hardware

<a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/key_switches.jpeg"><img alt="Key switches" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/key_switches.jpeg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">I like that I can customize the hardware, including
hot-swapping out the switches</div>

- In addition to the firmware, It's nice to know the extent to what I can
    *physically* change about my keyboard.
- I've looked around at some of the parts I could tweak on my board in a year
    or two if I want to mix things up (without actually getting a different
    board).
- I wouldn't be against possibly swapping to mx clears for example. The main
    issue is the backglow lights shouldn't shine through then...
    - Which isn't that big of an issue though, because many of the alternative
        keycaps I like are solid (link?)
- Despite talking about all the hardware upgrades I can make, I actually like
it's current configuration. I love the board as it is, and am in no rush to
swap everything out. I *love* that I can though.


### Ortholinear


### Split Design

<a href="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/laptop_stand.jpeg"><img alt="Ergodox around a laptop stand" src="../../img/posts/ergodox-ez-initial-review/laptop_stand.jpeg" style="max-width:
100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">A split design keyboard pairs nicely with a laptop stand.</div>

Having a split keyboard, specifically one that is completely split, is so nice
from an ergonimic use. I can basically lay my arms on my desk in whichever way
is most comfortable... and move my keyboard to match it.

Additionally, the split design allows it to pair nicely with laptop stands, as
I can have them sit closer to me, which helps with the smaller screen.

### Thumb keys

100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The thumb cluster of keys has allowed me to better utilize my thumbs, which has been a nice change</div>


## What I don't love
There's honestly not I don't *like*, but here is a thing or two that I maybe
don't *love*..

### Brown switches are a bit sensitive?


### Learning curve


### Cost


### It's difficult to switch back to my HHKB...
