## History - Org-mode
### Previous System

<a href="/img/posts/switched-to-joplin-notes/org-mode-notes.png">
<img alt="Emacs with a note opened in org-mode." src="/img/posts/switched-to-joplin-notes/org-mode-notes.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Emacs with a note opened in org-mode</div>

Explain basically what I used to do for notes.

### What I liked

<a href="/img/posts/switched-to-joplin-notes/org-notes-export-pages.png">
<img alt="Pictured of org notes exported to HTML" src="/img/posts/switched-to-joplin-notes/org-notes-export-pages.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">org-notes allowed me to link and export my notes to
HTML</div>

- `org-mode` is great.
- I could take all my notes in a simple markdown
- Simple code-block support
- Note linking
- Exported to html (or txt, md, pdf, or anything really)
- My previous notes were all exported to an archive website

### Issues
- Basically _had_ to use emacs for any edits
- Note supported on mobile devices
- Syncing issues (mostly Nextcloud issues. Seafile helped, but still)
