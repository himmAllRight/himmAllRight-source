As a [huge fan](/post/org-babel-setup/) of emacs's
[org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), it should be no surprise that I've been using
it for all of my personal and work planning/notes over the last few years.
However, as my daily emacs use slowly dropped and the support for `.org` files
outside of emacs remains low (besides [Github README
files](https://github.com/himmAllRight/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs)), I started
to look for a more standard system. [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) is what
I've been testing the last few months. Here are my thoughts.

## History - Org-mode
### Previous System

<div class="caption">Emacs with a note opened in org-mode</div>

Explain basically what I used to do for notes.

### What I liked

<img alt="Pictured of org notes exported to HTML" src="/img/posts/switched-to-joplin-notes/org-notes-export-pages.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">org-notes allowed me to link and export my notes to
HTML</div>

- `org-mode` is great.
- I could take all my notes in a simple markdown
- Simple code-block support
- Note linking
- Exported to html (or txt, md, pdf, or anything really)
- My previous notes were all exported to an archive website

### Issues
- Basically _had_ to use emacs for any edits
- Note supported on mobile devices
- Syncing issues (mostly Nextcloud issues. Seafile helped, but still)
