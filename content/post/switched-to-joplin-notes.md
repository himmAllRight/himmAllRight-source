## History - Org-mode

### What I liked

- `org-mode` is great.
- I could take all my notes in a simple markdown
- Simple code-block support
- Note linking
- Exported to html (or txt, md, pdf, or anything really)
- My previous notes were all exported to an archive website

### Issues
- Basically _had_ to use emacs for any edits
- Note supported on mobile devices
- Syncing issues (mostly Nextcloud issues. Seafile helped, but still)
