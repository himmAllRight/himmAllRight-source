This should be a short and quick post. Basically, I keep figuring out and then
forgetting how to disable Seafile notifications on Gnome (which doesn't allow
tray icons). This time, I'm recording the process.

## Background

Hold up. Why do I need to disable *Seafile* notications specifically? Well
because I sync my obsidian vaults using Seafile. However, unfortunately this
means is that every second that I type obsidian, seafile... uh... *politely
notifies me*, that it has synced my ongoing notes. Which is increadibly
annouying, to say the least. 

However, I don't want to simply disable *all* system notifications, just
*Seafile*. Luckily, Seafile has a setting to do this... if you can get to them.

### Install Tray Icons: Reloaded extension

The first step is to install an extension that allows application tray icons.
One extenstion that seems to "work" currently (with a catch, more on that
below), is [Tray Icons:
Reloaded](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2890/tray-icons-reloaded/). So,
to install it, open up the page in
[[Firefox]](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com),
and click the slider tab from `OFF` to `ON` in the top right of the page.

*Note: If this is the first extension being installed, Firefox may ask you to
*install a plugin. Just hit accept and it will do it for you.*


### (Optionally) Install Gnome Extensions app

Next, while *possibly* optional, it is ideal to have the *Gnome Extensions* app installed. So, open up the Software Center, and install it there, or as a flatpak from the command line:

```bash
sudo flatpak install org.gnome.Extensions
```

This just allows you to configure and enable an extenstion, in case it isn't on
by default. With Gnome Extensions opened, make sure `Tray Icons: Reloaded` is
turned on. *Note, icons likely won't show up still, even with the extension
enabled*.

### Switch to an Xorg Session

<div class="caption">Switching to Xorg Session</div>

This is the step I always forget (and hence why I'm writing this post). While
`Top Icons: Reloaded` "works" in Gnome 40... it only does in Xorg sessions. So,
log out, switch the session to `GNOME on Xorg` (gear icon at the bottom right of
the login screen), and log back in. Once logged in, the top icons should be
working, *hopefully* displaying the Seafile icon among them (assuming
`seafile-client` is running).


### Edit the Seafile Settings

<div class="caption">Accessing seafile settings from toolbar icon.</div>

To open up the Seafile settings, right click on the icon and select `Settings`.

<div class="caption">Changing notification setting</div>
</center>

From there, notifications can be **disabled** by **unchecking** the `Notify when libraries are synchronized` checkbox. Hit `OK`, and that's it. Feel free to log out and back in under a `Wayland` ðŸ™‚.

## Conclusion

That's it. Short post, but I forgot how to do it twice now, so I wrote a post. Hopefully this helps that one other person also experiencing this issue, or at least a few more that are confused for similar reasons. Enjoy!
