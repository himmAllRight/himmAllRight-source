This should be a short and quick post. Basically, I have had issues figuring out
and then remembering how to disable Seafile notifications when setting up Gnome
on an machine, because of how they hide desktop icons. I need to disable this
now, because I sync my obsidian with Seafile, so it constantly sends
notifications when I'm writing notes otherwise. Because I'm apt to forget my
work-around, I'll document it in a post even though it's a unique case.

## Install Try Icons: Reloaded extension


## Switch to an Xorg Session (this is the step I always forget)


## Use the now visible Seafile desktop icon to open it's settings, and disable the notifications
