A few years ago, [I purchased my first iPad](/post/getting-an-ipad/), a 10.
iPad Pro. The portability and versatility of the iPad ensure that it is a
devices that I use just about every single day. With the release of the newest
2021 iPad Pro last week, I decided it was finally time to trade mine in for an
upgrade. Here's why.

## History

When I got my 10.5" iPad Pro, the 2018 iPad Pro refresh had already been
released. However, I didn't think the extra features justified the price of the
new iPad *for me*, *at that time*. Instead, I the discount on the *old* pro was
way more appealing, especially because I was already upselling myself, after
originally looking into the base (non-pro) iPad.

I figured a discounted 10.5" pro was a nice sweet spot to start for my first
iPad, as it was a great device, but not too over the top in case I didn't
actually use it often. If I *did* use it, I could always upgrade/swap it out in
the future after I knew what I did and did not like/need from an iPad.

##  Why upgrade?

<a href="/img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/apple_pencil_tall.png"><img alt="Apple Pencil" src="/img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/apple_pencil_tall.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: right;"/></a>

After using my ipad for several months, I started to be able to understand how
the improved features on the 2018 pro would be nice. In particular, the USB C
port, smaller bezels, and FaceID were all very appealing. However, my 10.5"
suited my needs just fine. I did realize though that I *would* likely upgrade my
iPad sometime in the future.

Which brings me to the one thing I *did* want to get for my iPad: the Apple
Pencil.  Being able to write is a special feature unique to tablet computers
that I cannot do with any of my other devices. It's a foundational reason to
even *consider* owning a tablet. Additionally, in the years since I purchased my
iPad, new iPadOS releases have really started to polish the use of the 'magic'
pencil with the iPad.

However, my 10.5" ipad only supported the 1st generation Apple Pencil. Knowing
that I would *eventually* upgrade my iPad, I didn't want to buy an old pencil,
only to have to *also* replace it when I upgraded. So, I decided to wait to get
the Pencil until it was time to upgrade my device. Now feels like a good time.


## Why this generation?

There are a few factors that had me decide to upgrade with this generation of
the iPad Pro. First, I still can get a good bit of trade-in value for it, and
I'm not sure how long that will last with my iPad. If I want to trade it in with
Apple, I am limited to their store. While I could use the credit on a
refurbished device, Apple really hasn't had any used iPad Pros in stock since
the pandemic started.

Plus, there are a few new features of this latest generation that I think might be nice:

- While the M1 chip is complete overkill, I can appreciate it in an iPad
considering how much I love it  [my MacBook
Air](/post/m1-air-initial-thoughts/). Additionally, it provides a bit of
computational overhead (and increased RAM) in case Apple decides to push the
capabilities of iPadOS further (which they need to do).

-  While it seemed "gimmicky" at first, the wide-angle front-facing camera
paired with the new "Center Stage" feature on the 2021 iPad Pro could actually
be quite nice.  My wife and I use FaceTime to video chat my family (I live in
another state from everyone), and my ipad is usually what we use to do it. Being
able to more easily fit the two of us in frame, and have it self-adjust as my
wife comes and goes could be useful.

- Lastly, while USB-C is fine, Thunderbolt is better. I already have all of my
periphery gear hooked up to a thunderbolt dock to connect my work and personal
laptops to it. Also, the increased bandwidth helps "future proof" it (again,
assuming Apple can fix the OS).

## Why the 11" over the 12.9"?

<div class="caption">The iPad Pro Size Comparison</div>
</center>

Over the past few years, whenever I would think about upgrading my iPad Pro, I
always thought I would switch to the 12.9" version. So, now that I decided on getting
a 2021 iPad Pro, why have I instead opted for the 11" when the 12.9" is clearly the more
exciting option this year, having the new "Liquid Retina XDR" display? Well, as
much as I'd love to get that new display, that price bump makes it a bit more
unreasonable for a feature I *truly* don't
*need*. I don't do any type of visual work, and the display on the 11" Pro is
more than enough for anything I need.

However, the real reason is that I now have a great portable laptop, my M1 air.
I was previously looking at the bigger ipad to be my travel/portable device, but
now that I have the air, a 12.9" ipad with a keyboard would actually weigh more.
I want my ipad to be more portable than my mac (and cheaper!). As a bonus, if
the combined size and weight remains low, it's easy enough to travel with *both*
devices. For reference, a 11" iPad Pro (without a case) and my macbook Air have
a combined weight that is half a *pound less* than my previous [16" Macbook
Pro](/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/)!

##  Why not the new iPad Air?

Lastly, if I am looking at the 11" iPad Pro, why not consider the 2020 iPad Air?
I struggled with this decision for awhile, especially before the latest
generation pro was announced. In general, I think the air would be *fine* in
suiting my needs. The reality is that *both* of these devices are currently
overkill for *most* iPad tasks. *With that said*... I think the additional
features you get in the 2021 pro for the $200 difference is actually worth it
for *my* ipad use cases. Here are a few of those feature differences, and my
justificatoin for each:

-  **The Display**: I like the 120hz pro-motion display. I read all the time on
my ipad, and I love how smooth it is. In addition, if my plan is to get an Apple
pencil right away, the high refresh rate will help make *that* device perform
better.
    -  (Also, not a big deal, but the screen is a little brighter, which is nice
    when I want to read outside)

-  **Cameras**: As I said above, the ultrawide front camera is great for
FaceTime, as it is my FaceTime device

-   **Better speakers**: I love having nice speakers on my systems, especially
my travel devices. I've already downgraded my speakers going [from the 16" to
the m1 air](/post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/), and I don't want to do it again.
(The pro ipads have 4 spearks, whereas the air only has 2)

-   **Thunderbolt**: Not a deal breaker, but if I want to play around with testing an
[ipad as a modular
computer](https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/) at all, I
already have TB3 docks setup to use daily.

-   **Storage**: The base version pro has twice as much storage as the air. I
didn't think this was an issue, but then I looked at the usage on my ipad and
saw I was using 60/64GB... Which I assume will only continue to grow if I start
actually using the ipad to sketch diagrams and notes more often. To upgrade the
air, you have to jump to 256gb which is more than I need.  After that upgrade,
the air is less than $50 aways from the price of the pro.  Considering
everything else I listed above, I think it is definitely worth that additional
cost to me.

-   **LiDar** (seriously üòÜ): This is more of a novelty than a feature for most
people. Still, as someone that wants to play more with AR, or use their iPad to
help scan floor plan of their ohome, or just taking rough measurements... the
LiDar would help the iPad improve in all those tasks.

That's it. Those were *most* of my reasons of why I devicded to finally trade in
my 10.5" iPad Pro, for a new 2021 version. I have ordered the 2021 11" iPad Pro
(in silver), and selected to trade in my old one with the purchage. Now, all I
can do is wait for it to ship. It's been stuck *processing* for over a week, but
could *arrive* as early as two days ago üòê. Hopefully it ships soon...
