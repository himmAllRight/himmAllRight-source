## History
- I got a 10.5" iPad Pro a few years ago (link to post about it)
    -  When I got it, the 2018 iPad Pro refresh was out already, but I didn't think the extra features justified the price for the new pro at the time
    -  (I was actually already up-spec-ing from originally wanting the standard ipad)
    -  It was my first iPad, and I figured it I loved it, I would eventually upgrade it.

##  Why upgrade?

-  I've wanted to get an Apple Pencil for my ipad for awhile now. 
    -  However, I didn't wan't to get one for my 10.5", because it used the 1st gen pencil, and I wanted the new one for when I eventually upgrade
    -  So, I held off until I would upgrade
-  Also, I started appreciate the features and difference of the Pro (now that it's in it's 3rd gen ðŸ˜†)
    -  FaceID works well for me (my fingers peel often and gives me issues with touch)
    -  I like the design, with less bezel
    -  USB C/TB3 would be very nice, esp if I want to play with docking it (since I already have hubs for my laptops)

## Why this generation?

-  I still can potentially get a good bit of trade-in value for it (not sure how long that will last this many years out now...)
-  The M1 is overkill, but appreciated after loving my MacBook Air (link to post)
-  As much as it seems "gimmicky", the wide-angle camera feature would actually be nice, since we use always FaceTime to video chat with my family (I live in another state from everyone), and my wife and I always use my ipad.

## Why the 11" over the 12.9"?

-  I'd love to get that new display, but honestly, that price bump makes it a bit more unreasonable
-  The real reason though, is that I now have a great portable laptop with the air. I was previously looking at the bigger ipad to maybe be my travel/portable device, but now that I have the air, a 12.9" ipad with a keyboard would actually weigh more. I want my ipad to be more portable than my mac (and cheaper!).

##  Why not the new iPad Air?
-  I struggled with this decision for awhile, especially before the latest generation pro was announced
-  While I think the air would be *fine* in suiting my needs, with the new pro, I think the features you get for the $200 difference is actually worth it for *me*.
    -  I like having the 120 hz pro-motion display. I read a lot on my ipad, and I love how smooth it is. I would probably be fine without it, but it is something I enjoy, and If my plan is to get a pencil right away with it, that high refresh rate will be appreciated (especially because I'm used to it with mine). 
        -  Also, not a big deal, but the screen is a little brighter, which is nice when I want to read outside
    -  As I said, the ultrawide front camera is nice for FaceTime, as it is my FaceTime device
    -   Better speakers. I love having nice speakers on my systems, especially my travel devices like laptop and tablet. I've already downgraded my speakers going from the 16" to the m1 air, and I don't want to do it again going from the 4 to 2 speaks between my 10.5" and the 
    -   TB3 is nice, if I wan't to play around with testing an ipad as a "modular computer" (link?) at all, I already have docks and have them setup to use daily.
    -   Higher base storage. The base version of the pro has twice as much storage as the air. I didn't think this was an issue, but then I looked at my usage on my ipad and say I was using nearly 60 of my 64gb... Which I assume will just be higher if I start actually using my ipad to sketch diagrams and stuff more often. To upgrade the air, you have to jump to 256gb which is probably more than I need, and after the upgrade, makes the air less than $50 from the price of the pro... and everything else I've listed is deff worth that cost to me
    -   LiDar is deff. more of a novelty than a feature for most people still, but as someone that does like the idea of playing more with AR, or using an iPad to help scan a home floor plan/taking measurements, it would make the device much better at those tasks.
    -   M1 is nice, but honestly more than enough for what ever I will put this ipad through

## Conclusion
