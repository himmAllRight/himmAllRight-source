A few years ago, [I purchased my first iPad](/post/getting-an-ipad/), a 10.5"
iPad Pro. I use it just about every day. With the release of the newest 2021
iPad Pro, I decided it was finally time to trade mine in for an upgrade. Here's
why.

## History

When I got my 10.5" iPad Pro, the 2018 11" iPad Pro had already been released.
At the time, I didn't think the extra features justified the increased
price of the new iPad. The discount price on the *old* pro was more appealing to
me. I was already upselling myself, after originally looking into the base
(non-pro) iPad, so the discounted 10.5" seemed like a good compromise between
features and price.

The 10.5" pro was a good starting point for my first iPad. It was a great
device, but not too over the top in case I ended up not using it much. If I
*did* use it, I could always upgrade/swap it out in the future.

##  Why upgrade?

<a href="/img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/apple_pencil_tall.png"><img alt="Apple Pencil" src="/img/posts/upgrading-ipad-pro-2021/apple_pencil_tall.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 250px; float: right;"/></a>

After having my ipad for several months, I started to understand how the
improved features of the 2018 pro could be nice to have. In particular, the
USB-C port, smaller bezels, and FaceID were all very appealing to me.  Still, my
10.5" suited my needs just fine. I did decide though that I *would* likely
upgrade my iPad sometime in the future. I enjoyed having it.

Which brings me to the one thing I *did* want to add to my iPad: the Apple
Pencil.  Being able to hand draw is a special feature unique to tablet computers
that I cannot easily reproduce on my other devices. It's a foundational reason
to even *consider* owning a tablet. Additionally, in the years since I purchased
my iPad, new iPadOS releases have started to polish the use of the 'magic'
pencil with the iPad.

Unfortunately, my 10.5" ipad only supported the 1st generation Apple Pencil.
Knowing that I would *eventually* upgrade my iPad, I didn't want to buy an old
pencil, only to have to *also* replace it when I upgraded. So, I decided to wait
to get the Pencil until it was time to upgrade my device. Now feels like a good
time.


## Why this generation?

</center>

There are a few factors that pushed me to upgrade to *this* generation of the
iPad Pro. First, I can still get a decent trade-in value for it.  Considering
it's been about 4 years since the 10.5" model was released, I'm not sure how
long that value last with my iPad. Second, if I want to trade it in with Apple
(and I do, it's probably the easiest method), I am limited to spending the
credit value in their store. While I could try to get a refurbished device,
there hasn't been many used iPad Pros in stock since the pandemic started. So
the latest model is my best bet.

Beyond ease of trade-in, there are a few new features in this latest generation
that I am interested in:

- The M1 chip is complete overkill, but I wouldn't mind having one in my iPad
considering how much I love it  [my MacBook
Air](/post/m1-air-initial-thoughts/). Additionally, it provides more
computational overhead (and increased RAM) incase Apple ever decides to finally
push the capabilities of iPadOS further (which they need to do).

-  While I thought it was a bit of a gimmick at first, the wide-angle
front-facing camera paired with the new "Center Stage" feature on the 2021 iPad
Pro could actually be useful.  My wife and I use FaceTime to video chat with my
family (we live in another state from everyone), and my ipad is usually what we
use to do it. Being able to more easily fit the two of us in frame, and have it
self-adjust as my wife comes and goes would be delightful.

- Lastly, while USB-C is great, Thunderbolt is better. I already have all of my
periphery gear hooked up to a thunderbolt dock to connect my work and personal
laptops to. The increased bandwidth also helps to "future proof" (again,
assuming Apple can improve the OS).

## Why the 11" over the 12.9"?

<div class="caption">The iPad Pro Size Comparison</div>
</center>

Whenever I would think about upgrading my iPad Pro, I always figured I would
switch to a 12.9" version. So why then have I instead opted for the 11" when the
12.9" is clearly the more exciting option this year, having the new "Liquid
Retina XDR" display? Well, as much as I'd enjoy seeing that new display, that
price bump makes it a bit more unreasonable for a feature I *truly do not need*.
I don't do any visual work, and the display on the 11" Pro is more than enough
for anything I need.

The real reason for the 11", is that I now have a great portable laptop.  I was
previously looking at the bigger ipad to be my travel/portable device, but now
that I have an m1 air, a 12.9" ipad with a keyboard would actually weigh *more*.
I want my ipad to be more portable than my mac. As a bonus, if
the combined size and weight remains low, it's easy enough to travel with *both*
devices. For reference, a 11" iPad Pro (without a case) and my macbook Air have
a *combined weight* of only 3.6 lbs, whereas my previous [16" Macbook
Pro](/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/) alone weighed 4.3lbs! I would like to keep this portability.

##  Why not the new iPad Air?

Lastly, if I am contemplating getting the 11" iPad Pro, why not consider the
2020 iPad Air? I struggled with this decision for awhile, particularly before
the latest generation pro was announced. In general, I think the air would be
*fine* and meet all of my needs. The reality is that *both* of these devices
are currently overkill for most iPad tasks. *With that said*... I think the
additional features of the 2021 pro are actually worth the $200 difference (in
my case). Here are a few of those feature differences, and my justification for
the pro:

-  **The Display**: I like the 120hz pro-motion display. I read all the time on
my ipad, and I love how smooth it is. In addition, if my plan is to get an Apple
pencil right away, the high refresh rate can help *the pencil's* responsiveness also feel better.
    -  (furthermore, while not a *big* deal, the screen is a little brighter
    on the pro, which is appreciated when I want to read outside)

-  **Cameras**: As I said above, the ultra wide front camera is great for
FaceTime, as it is my FaceTime device.

-   **Better speakers**: I love having nice speakers on my systems, especially
my travel devices. I've already downgraded my laptop speakers going [from the
16" to the m1 air](/post/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/), and I don't want to do it
again. (The pro has 4 speakers, whereas the air only has 2).

- **FaceID**: TouchID is great, but my finger tips tend to peel due to
allergies, and FaceID simply works more consistently for me.

-   **Thunderbolt**: Not a deal breaker, but if I want to play around with testing an
[ipad as a modular
computer](https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/) at all, I
already have TB3 docks setup to use.

-   **Storage**: The base version pro has twice as much storage as the air. I
didn't think this was an issue, but then I looked at the usage on my ipad and
saw I had consumed 60/64GB. I expect my usages will only continue to grow if I
begin to sketch diagrams and notes more often. The air also starts at 64GB,
where the pro begins with 128GB of storage. To upgrade the air, you need to jump
to all the way up to the 256gb hard drive.  After that upgrade, the air is less
than $50 away from the price of the pro.  Considering everything else I listed
above, I think it is definitely worth that additional cost.

-   **LiDar** (seriously üòÜ): This is more of a novelty than a feature for most
people. Still, as someone that likes to play with AR, uses their iPad to scan
floor plans of their house, or to take rough measurements... the LiDar would
help the iPad improve all those tasks.

There you go. Those were *most* of my reasons for why I concluded to finally
trade in my 10.5" iPad Pro, for a new 11" model. I have ordered the 2021
11" iPad Pro (in silver), along with an Apple Pencil 2, and selected to trade in
my old one with the purchase. Now, all I can do is wait for it to ship. It's
been stuck
*processing* for over a week, but
could *arrive* as early as two days ago üòê. Hopefully it ships soon...
