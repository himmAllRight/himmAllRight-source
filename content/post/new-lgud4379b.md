After a decade of weilding several combinations of dual monitors, I
have dicided to upgrade to using a single, but *better*,
monitor. After two years of debating, I have finally made my choice.

## Monitor History

<div class="caption">My monitor setup right before moving to college</div>

Half way through high school, I purchased my first laptop (it was also
the first computer I installed Linux on. I had a special edition
model, but it was very similar to [this
one](https://www.cnet.com/products/hp-pavilion-dv6000/specs/)). The
laptop was replacing an old base e-machines desktop, so I also had a
spare monitor that I could link up to the latop. From that point on, I
*usually* had two screens to look at, even if one was my laptopscreen
at the far end of my desk, with an
[AIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)) window open in
it. When I built my desktop before moving to college (picture above), I
also purchased a second monitor for it.

Throught college, as I started to explore Linux and programming more,
I started to experiment with using monitors in a portrait orientation,
and eventually purchased a second 23.6" 1080p monitor so they would
match when paired. It gave me much more vertical realestate that was
very usefull when writting code or reports.

## Why go from two, to one?

While I like having the *screen realistate* of two monitors, I was
never able optimally use them because of the bezels. 

-- Talk about how I basically had the choice of using a primary +
secondary setup, or to center them (which was better with portrait),
but it meant my optimal viewing was stairing at... two black pieces of
plastic...

-- With the rise of ultrawide and large form UHD monitors (and fall of
their prices)... I can get around this.

## Ultrawide or *Large* UHD?

## Deciding on the 43" UHD

## Getting the UD4379b

## What I like

#### IPS Display

#### Screen Realistate

#### Single Monitor, No Bezels

#### Flexability, multiple inputs



## What I don't like

#### Edge Shadowing

#### Input Switching lag?

#### Gaming?
