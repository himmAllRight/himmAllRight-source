After a decade of weilding several combinations of dual monitors, I
have dicided to upgrade to using a single, but *better*,
monitor. After two years of debating, I have finally made my choice.

## Monitor History

<div class="caption">My monitor setup right before moving to college</div>

Half way through high school, I purchased my first laptop (it was also
the first computer I installed Linux on. I had a special edition
model, but it was very similar to [this
one](https://www.cnet.com/products/hp-pavilion-dv6000/specs/)). The
laptop was replacing an old base e-machines desktop, so I also had a
spare monitor that I could link up to the latop. From that point on, I
*usually* had two screens to look at, even if one was my laptopscreen
at the far end of my desk, with an
[AIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)) window open in
it. When I built my desktop before moving to college (picture above), I
also purchased a second monitor for it.

Throught college, as I started to explore Linux and programming more,
I started to experiment with using monitors in a portrait orientation,
and eventually purchased a second 23.6" 1080p monitor so they would
match when paired. It gave me much more vertical realestate that was
very usefull when writting code or reports.

## Why go from two, to one?

<div class="caption">When using two monitors, I always had to have a primary and secondary.</div>

While I like having the *screen realistate* of two monitors, I was
never able to optimally use them because of the bezels. Over time, I
began to notice that while working, I would natually shift over and
use one monitor as a *primary* display, and the other as a *secondary*
display. This was okay for some tasks, but it usually just meant that
I just used the primary monitor, and *half* of the secondary one,
because it was too hard to see far end of the screen. 

This issue was *slightly* better when using my displays in portrait
mode, but this wasn't always ideal when connecting to remote machiens,
or VMs. It also still didn't solve the main issue, that when I looked
at the screens in my natural position (head centered, looking straigt
forward)... I saw two pieces of black plastic. I wanted to see my
*primary* window straigt in front of me, and then have some auxilary
space on either side for documentation or terminal windows. I wanted a
wide screen display.

## Ultrawide or *Large* 16:9 UHD?

Luckily over the past few years, the once *extremely* expensive
ultrawide and large UHD monitors have started to come down in
price. After following the market for a long time, I narrowed my
decision to my favorite choice in each category: The [Dell
u3415w](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-34-curved-ultrawide-monitor-u3415w/apd/210-adtr/monitors-monitor-accessories)
and the [LG ud4379b](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-43UD79-B-4k-uhd-led-monitor).

<a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/dellu3415w.jpg"><img alt="Dell u3415w" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/dellu3415w.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The Dell u3415w 34" 3440x1440p Ultra Wide Monitor </div>

The Dell u3415w is the slightly older (compared to the
[u34**17**w](https://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-u3417w-monitor/pd))
34" ultrawide monitor offering from Dell. It has an 3440x1440 60 Hz,
slightly-curved, IPS panel sitting on a solid but adjustable monitor
stand. I liked it compared to other ultrawides because it could be
found for a reasonable price, and had a very professional build
quality.

Based on my reasons listed above, an ultrawide (1440p ones... not
1080p) would fit my mostly programmer use-case very well. Being a
single monitor, I could position it directly in front of me, with my
main code/content centered. The 3440px wide resolution would also
allow enough horizontal space to have a full webpage of documentation,
and several terminal windows open on either side of the main
display. Lastly, the 1440px vertical resolution would be an adaquit
improvement from my *"starting to feel very tight"*, 1080p monitors.

<div class="caption">The LG ud4379b 42.5" 3440x2160p Monitor</div>

The massive LG ud4379b is a 42.5" 3840x2160px IPS display. At this
size and resolution, it is roughly the equivalant to having 4 21"
1920x1080px monitors aligned in a 2x2 grid... but with 0 bezel between
them. Compared to other 40"+ 4K displays, I liked this one because
again, it was reasonably priced, and also seemed to actualy have a
half decent panel. Reviewers consistantly said it had good colors and
minimal backlight bleed.

Being a single monitor, I could easily center myself in front of it,
and have my main content center just like in the ultrawide. Being so
large, I could also still have auxilary windows opened on the
sides. One advantage the ud4379 had over the ultrawide however, was
that being a massive 16:9 screen, it could easily be divided into 4
1080p screens (in fact, this model supports spitting the screen into
4, each takings a seperate input. But more on that later..). While the
ultrawides often support splitting and picture in picture, it seems
more versitile on the 43" monitor.

## Deciding on the 43" UHD

<div class="caption">The LG ud4379 can support multiple inputs at a time to the single display</div>

I went back and forth on what type of monitor I wanted several
times. Eventually though I realized the long term versitility of the
Lg monitor was just something I couldn't ignore. Being able to use it
as one massive display that I could fit several full VM windows on, or
even as 1,2, or 4 discrete monitors made it super usefull for me. I
tend to be playing with more than one computer or Vm at a time, and it
is VERY nice to have them all fit so nicely on a single display. I was
worried it would be a bit *too* big and look a little stupid on my
desk, especially compared to how slick the Ultrawide would
look. However, in the end, practicality won out.

## Getting the UD4379b

<div class="caption">The Monitor arrived a few days later perfectly safe, despite the beat up box</div>

After planning that we would likely order my monitor for my birthday
gift, my wife and I started watching the price a few weeks before. One
day, we noticed the price had dropped $200... so we ordered it.

It came a few days latter in a massive box that I happily carted up to
our appartment. The box was a bit beat up, but after opening it up, it
luckily looked like all the components were fine.

## What I like

#### IPS Display

#### Screen Realistate

#### Single Monitor, No Bezels

#### Flexability, multiple inputs



## What I don't like

#### Edge Shadowing
