After a decade of using several combinations of *dual* monitors, I
have decided to upgrade to using a single, but *better*,
monitor. After two years of debating, I have finally made my choice.

## Monitor History
<a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/pre-college-monitors.jpg"><img alt="Pre College monitors" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/pre-college-monitors.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">My monitor setup right before moving to college</div>

Half way through high school, I purchased my first laptop (it also happens to
be the first computer I installed Linux on. I had a special edition model, but it was
very similar to [this
one](https://www.cnet.com/products/hp-pavilion-dv6000/specs/)). The laptop was
replacing an old standard E-machines desktop, so I kept the spare monitor to
use with the laptop. From that point on, I *usually* had two screens to look
at, even if one was just my laptop's screen at the far end of my desk, with an
[AIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)) window open in it. Before
moving to college, I built a desktop computer with a new monitor (picture
above), and utilized the old one as a secondary display.

<div class="caption">My desk during my senior year of collage</div>

Throughout college, as I started to explore Linux and programming more,
I began to experiment with using monitors in portrait orientations.
Eventually, I purchased a second 23.6" 1080p monitor so they would
match when paired. This gave me much more vertical real estate, which was
useful when writing code, essays, or lab reports.

## Why go from two, to one?

<div class="caption">When using two monitors, I always had to have a primary and secondary.</div>

While I like having the *screen real estate* of two monitors, I was never able
to optimally use them because of the bezels between the monitors.  While
working, I would naturally shift over and use one monitor as a *primary*
display, and the other as a *secondary* display. This was okay for some tasks,
but it usually just meant that I just used the primary monitor, and *half* of
the secondary one, because it was too hard to see the far end of the screen.

This issue was *slightly* better when using my displays in portrait mode, but
that wasn't always ideal when connecting to remote machines, or viewing wide
content (videos, for example). It also didn't solve the main issue. When
looking at the screens in a natural position (head centered, looking strait
forward)... I still saw two pieces of black plastic. I wanted to see my
*primary* window directly in front of me, with some auxiliary space on either
side for documentation and terminal windows. I wanted a wide screen display.

## Ultra-wide or *Large* 16:9 UHD?

Luckily, the once *extremely* expensive ultra-wide and large UHD monitors have
started to come down in price. After following the market for a few years, I
narrowed my decision to my favorite choice in each category: The [Dell
u3415w](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-34-curved-ultrawide-monitor-u3415w/apd/210-adtr/monitors-monitor-accessories)
and the [LG
ud4379b](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-43UD79-B-4k-uhd-led-monitor).

<a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/dellu3415w.jpg"><img alt="Dell u3415w" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/dellu3415w.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The Dell u3415w 34" 3440x1440p Ultra Wide Monitor </div>

The Dell u3415w is the slightly older (compared to the
[u34**17**w](https://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-u3417w-monitor/pd)) 34"
ultra-wide monitor offering from Dell. It has a 3440x1440, 60 Hz,
slightly-curved, IPS panel sitting on a solid and adjustable monitor stand. I
preferred it over other ultra-wides because it could be found for a reasonable
price, and had a professional build quality.

Based on my reasoning explained in the section above, an ultra-wide (1440p
ones... not 1080p) would fit my mostly programmer use-case very well. Being a
single monitor, I could position it directly in front of me, with my main
code/content centered. The 3440px wide resolution would also allow enough
horizontal space to have a full web page of documentation, and several terminal
windows open on either side of the main display. Lastly, the 1440px vertical
resolution would be an adequate improvement from my *"starting to feel tight"*,
1080p monitors.

<a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/ud4379b.jpg"><img alt="Dell u3415w" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/ud4379b.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The LG ud4379b 42.5" 3440x2160p Monitor</div>

The massive LG ud4379b is a 42.5" 3840x2160px IPS display. At this size and
resolution, it is roughly the equivalent of having four 21" 1920x1080px
monitors aligned in a 2x2 grid... except with 0 bezel between them. Compared to
other 40"+ 4K displays, I preferred this one because once again, it was
reasonably priced, had great input options, and also seemed to have a half
decent panel. Reviewers consistently said it had vibrant colors and minimal
back light bleed.

Being single monitor, I could easily sit myself in front of it, and have my
main content centered, just like with the ultra-wide. Being so large, I could
still have auxiliary windows opened on either side. One advantage the ud4379
had over the ultra-wide however, was that being a massive 16:9 screen, it could
easily be divided into 4 1080p screens. In fact, this model supports spitting
the screen into four separate displays, each taking a different input (more on
that later..). While the ultra-wides often support splitting and
picture-in-picture, it seems more natural on the 43" monitor.

## Deciding on the 43" UHD

style="max-width: 100%;"/></a> <div class="caption">The LG ud4379 can support
multiple inputs at a time to the single display</div>

I went back and forth on which monitor I wanted several times. Eventually, I
realized the long term versatility of the LG monitor was just something I could
not ignore. Being able to use it as one massive display that I could fit
several full VM windows in, or even as 1,2, or 4 discrete monitors makes it
extremely useful for me. I tend to be playing with more than one computer or VM
at a time, and it is VERY nice to have them all fit on a single display. I
*was* worried it would be a bit *too* large and look stupid on my desk,
especially compared to how slick the ultra-wide would look. However, in the
end, practicality won out.

## Getting the UD4379b

100%;"/></a> <div class="caption">The Monitor arrived a few days later
perfectly safe, despite the beat up box</div>

After deciding that we would likely order the monitor as my birthday gift, my
wife and I started watching the price a few weeks before. One day, we noticed
the price had dropped $200... so we ordered it. The price soon went back up, so
I'm glad we snatched it when we did!

It came a few days latter in a massive box that I happily carted up to our
apartment. The box was a bit beat up, but after opening it, all the components
were fine.

## What I like

<a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-working.png"><img alt="Monitor Working" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-working.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">I can have my main content front and center, with other windows on the sides</div>

- **Screen Resolution** - The most obvious Pro using a monitor at this
    size and resolution... is the screen real estate. As explained above,
    it's twice the size of my old, dual 1080p monitor setup. With this
    space, I can easily have several code files, documentation, a few
    terminals, a chat window, and even a video opened on my single
    screen as I work.

- **IPS Display** - Many people might assume that the driving factor
    pushing me to *finally* update was my desire for more screen
    resolution. While that was *part* of my goal... what really
    motivated me was my desire to switched to an IPS display on my main
    setup. After almost a year using my T470's IPS display (which is
    *not a good IPS panel*, mind you). As someone who spends a large
    percentage of their computing time in terminals and IDEs, an IPS
    panel really helps text and colors pop, because the darks look *so*
    much better. It turns out, this panel is actually quite good for
    it's price, and I am very happy with it.

    <div class="caption">When working, I can look straight at a single display and still have enough room.</div>

- **Single Monitor, No (center) Bezels** - As explained earlier in this
    post, I like that this is is a *single* monitor. This means I am no
    longer needing to twist my head back and forth, or forced to stare
    at bezels. I can looks straight ahead and see my main content, with
    my "auxiliary" windows view-able off in my periphery.

- **Flexability, multiple inputs** - Lastly, I enjot the multiple
    inputs, and excellent PIP system of this monitor. Combined with
    something like [Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy), I can easily
    use this one display with several devices at a time. This is great
    when working with more than one device, or watching content on
    something like a chromecast stick, while still working on the
    computer. It really is the flexability of having 4 monitors, but in
    a single package.

- **Speakers** - They aren't *amazing*, and as such I don't use them
    too often, but for "monitor" speakers, they really aren't half
    bad. They're what you'd expect from a TV. However, this means that
    if I were to use something like a media stick, the build-in speaker
    are at least acceptable enough for such a device.



## What I don't like

<a href="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-shading.png"><img alt="Monitor Shading" src="../../img/posts/new-lgud4379b-monitor/monitor-shading.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Viewed from the center, the monitor edges have shadowing.</div>

- **Edge Shadowing** - The one issue that myself
    [and](https://youtu.be/yA6hL3inqRc?t=250)
    [others](https://youtu.be/3BSaPRHrA_U?t=667) have experience with
    this monitor is a sort of "edge shadowing". This is apparently
    something that is sort of common on monitors this massive, and it's
    really hard to engineer around. If I sit back far enough from the
    display, you can't see it anymore.

- **Input Switching Lag?** - While this is more of a critique of
    *monitors* in general, one thing I wish was a bit better was the input
    switching. Having so many inputs, it can get confusing remembering which one is
    attached to which device, or trying to quickly configure a 2x2 multi-input
    layout. Having to *wait* for each device to connect when flipping through all
    the inputs makes it that much more frustrating (and disappointing when it's the
    wrong input...).

- **Corners Out of View** - Being such a large display, one issue I
    sometimes have is that the outside corners are out of my field of view.
    I mostly experience this issue by sometimes missing notification pop-ups
    that I *want* to see. On the flip-side, notifications don't seem to
    distract me as much now when I'm trying to focus :P.

## Conclusion

<div class="caption">New monitor on my desk.</div>

In conclusion, I an *very* happy with my new monitor. It fits all of the
criteria I had, and works for my use-case perfectly. While I wouldn't
recommend it for a pure gaming machine, it might be one of the best deal
*productivity* monitors out there.
