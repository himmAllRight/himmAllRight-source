Intro Paragraph.

<!--more-->

I think I'm going to split the post into just overall themes/take-aways I got
from the event. I don't want to just rehash each talk I went to/everything I
learned. So, I might make a few theme groups and in each one pull the overall
theme I noticed in a few talks, maybe giving examples.

I also want to share some things I took away from it, for example books to
read.



## Topics


### Linux Stuff
- Practical ZFS by Sim Salter
- Getting Started with Flatpak
- What you most likely did not know about `sudo`
- Terraform?


### Mentoring/Teaching
- Gamifing Education
- Those wh ocan Do, Should Also Teach

- Not you're average mentoring talk (teaching or community section, maybe use
    it to lead into community discussions?)

### Communities
- Jono's talk about communities?
- Cultures?
-

Both of the books I came away wanting to read are in this category: *The
Culture  Map*, and Jono Bacon's upcoming book, *People Powered*.

### Diversity and Inclusion


### Burn-out/Team Dynamics
