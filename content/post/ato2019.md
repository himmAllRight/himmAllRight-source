Two weeks ago, I attended [All Things Open (2019)](https://allthingsopen.org)
for the second year in a row. ATO is an annual conference that explores and
celebrates, well... all things *open*. Open source, open tech, and open
communities are all main topics of the conference. Best of all, it's right here
in the triangle (Raleigh NC). Here are some of my overall take-aways from this
year.


<!--more-->

While the talks are always full of information, the *main* benefit I receive from
attending the conference each year is a list of technologies and ideas I want to
test out. So, that is what I want to share.

Rather than go into boring detail about each talk I went to, I am going to
elaborate on some common topics/themes I experienced throughout my two days,
and what I am excited to dig into as a result.

## Topics

### 1) Tech

#### I am going to keep using ZFS for my server
It happened again. Over the last few months I've entertained the idea of moving
off of ZFS on my home server for something like mergerfs + snapraid. Then I
went to a [Jim Salter](https://jrs-s.net/) ZFS talk, and just like last time...
I want to ZFS all the things. So, it looks like I'll be sticking with on the
server... and maybe give it a quick tune-up.

#### I want to start building some Flatpaks
Being a [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) user, I rely
*heavily* on flatpaks for many of my applications these days. While I have
played around a built the demo "hello world" flatpak in the past, this is
something I think I want to dig deeper into. Knowing how to build flatpaks
would be extremely useful. It would enable me to package up software I need to
use, but then also allow me to contribute my efforts to the community.

#### `sudo` is awesome.  I already knew this, but I always forget *how much*
`sudo` can do. Like `ssh`, the possibilities of being well informed about the
advanced options of `sudo` are endless. I think I'm going to start to dig
deeper into some of the settings, and see what I can find.

#### I need to automate my cloud provisioning
This has been on my list for awhile now, but after seeing so many
demonstrations of people using terraform and chef to spin up their cloud
environments... I need to start adding some provisioning roles to my ansible
playbooks. I think using the Digital Ocean module to spin up/tear down
temporary project droplets might be a good start...


### 2) Mentoring/Teaching
#### Large Scale Mentoring
One of my favorite talks of the conference was co-done by two kubernetes
contributers (from Red Hat and Google). They explained how the kubernetes
project tackles the big problem of mentoring... specifically how you even do it
in a several-thousand contributer project that may also have a bunch of fly-by
contributers.

What I enjoyed most about their mentoring system was how they organized it.
First, they went through and defined all the leadership roles, and then
*documented* what the role was, and how it is done. Next, they made a mentoring
chart for all the defined roles, listing the person for each role, and then the
person(s) next-in-line that are training for that role. I think this is a great
system for communities, and I might see if I can take some lessons from this
structure and help apply it to some volunteer organizations I work with.

#### Gamifing Education
Another interesting education talk I went to was about gamifying education.  In
the past, whenever I encountered topics of trying to gamify education, they
usually involved how to add gaming aspects to current methods of teaching
(points for answering questions, leveling up in difficulty, etc). This talk
however, focused on making games (ex: board games) that *just happen* to teach
children concepts as they play. It went in depth about what to keep in mind
while designing such a game, and gave great examples about aspects I wouldn't
think of. For example, it is encouraged to design the games, so that they could
use any random items that could be found in a kitchen (rice, rocks, beans) as
the game pieces. This is something I would not think to do, but lowers the
barrier to play so that children in all sorts of situations are able to play,
wherever they are.

Best of all, the talk concluded with the suggestion to host game
sources/documentation in a public repo, like Github.  This not only makes the
game accessible to people all over the world, but allows the community to
improve and expand on it. If there was something confusing in the
documentation, another perspective can fix it. Or, the community might invent
new variations for the game, improving it over time. The talk showcased how we
can take the best aspects of open source, and use them to maybe make learning a
bit more fun and accessible.

#### Those who can Do, Should Also Teach

As someone that struggled to focus in traditional lecture-style classes, but
thrived in more hands-on lab courses, I am always looking for new methods and
ways to help others learn (see section above). One talk I went to encouraged
people to start teaching others as they grow their skill. The talk provided
tips and approaches for teaching others that where helpful to hear from someone
experienced in specifically teaching tech.

As I sat in the talk, I started to brain storm what I can do to better extend
my ability to teach others. A big motivation behind this website is that it
allows me to share my experiences so others can (*hopefully*) learn from them.
I wondered what changes I could make to my website to accomplish that *better*,
or even new avenues I could take to help share my experience.


### 3) Communities/Diversity and Inclusion

I first listed "*Communities*" and "*Diversity and Inclusion*" as too separate
topics, but as I started sorting talk topics into the categories... I realized
these two overlapped all the time. So I merged them.

Honestly, this topic was so prevalent at ATO, that it's hard to summarize, even
a little bit. From the *curb cutting effect*, to diversifying recruiters since
people tend to hire others like themselves, to continually switching up who
leads meetings, there was all sorts of facts and tips about how to build
stronger, more diverse communities.

This topic seemed to spark my curiosity, and I ended up walking away with two
new books added to my reading list: *The Culture Map* by Erin Meyer, and Jono
Bacon's upcoming book, *People Powered*.


### 4) Burn-out/Team Dynamics

Last but not least, there were talks about another surprisingly related topic
pair, team dynamics and burn-out (cause and effect). Each talk on these topics
I witnessed was *really well delivered* which is fortunate as I think these are
both important topics, especially in the tech industry. To summarize, I'll
list 3 items I already regard as highly important, but came up *again and again* in these talks:

- Multi-tasking isn't real
- Stop trying to blame people
- Life outside of work is important (eat well, get more sleep, have a hobby)

## Conclusion

So after my second year at All Things Open, would I recommend it? Absolutely.
No matter why someone is interested in open source (the tech, the community
aspects, sharing with others), there will be something there for them.
