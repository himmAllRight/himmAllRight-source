Two weeks ago, I attended [All Things Open (2019)](https://allthingsopen.org)
for the second year in a row. ATO is an annual conference that explores and
celebrates, well... all things *open*. Open source, open tech, and open
communities are all main topics of the conference. Best of all, it's right here
in the triangle (Raleigh NC). Here are some of my overall take-aways from this
year.


<!--more-->

While the talks are always full of information, the *main* benefit I receive from
attending the conference each year is a list of technologies and ideas I want to
test out. So, that is what I want to share.
Rather than go into boring detail about each talk I went to, I am going to
elaborate on some common topics/themes I experienced throughout my two days,
and what I am excited to dig into as a result.


## Topics


### Linux/Systems Stuff

#### I am going to keep using ZFS for my server
It happened again. Over the last few months I've entertained the idea of moving
off of ZFS on my home server for something like mergerfs + snapraid. Then I
went to a [Jim Salter](https://jrs-s.net/) ZFS talk, and just like last time...
I want to ZFS all the things. So, it looks like I'll be sticking with on the
server... and maybe give it a quick tune-up.

#### I want to start building some Flatpaks
Being a [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) user, I rely
*heavily* on flatpaks for many of my applications these days. While I have
played around a built the demo "hello world" flatpak in the past, this is
something I think I want to dig deeper into. Knowing how to build flatpaks
would be extremely useful. It would enable me to package up software I need to
use, but then also allow me to contribute my efforts to the community.

#### `sudo` is awesome.  I already knew this, but I always forget *how much*
`sudo` can do. Like `ssh`, the possibilities of being well informed about the
advanced options of `sudo` are endless. I think I'm going to start to dig
deeper into some of the settings, and see what I can find.

#### I need to automate my cloud provisioning
This has been on my list for awhile now, but after seeing so many
demonstrations of people using terraform and chef to spin up their cloud
environments... I need to start adding some provisioning roles to my ansible
playbooks. I think using the Digital Ocean module to spin up/tear down
temporary project droplets might be a good start...


### Mentoring/Teaching
#### Not you're average mentoring talk
One of my favorite talks of the conference was co-done by two kubernetes
contributers (from Red Hat and Google). They explained how the kubernetes
project tackles the big problem of mentoring... specifically how you even do it
in a several-thousand contributer project that may also have a bunch of fly-by
contributers.

What I enjoyed most about their mentoring system was how they organized it.
First, they went through and defined all the leadership roles, and then
*documented* what the role was, and how it is done. Next, they made a mentoring
chart for all the defined roles, listing the person for each role, and then the
person(s) next-in-line that are training for that role. I think this is a great
system for communities, and I might see if I can take some lessons from this
structure and help apply it to some volunteer organizations I work with.

#### Gamifing Education
Another interesting education talk I went to was about gamifying education.
In the past, whenever I encountered topics of trying to gamify education,

- Those who can Do, Should Also Teach


### Communities
- Jono's talk about communities?
- Cultures?
-

Both of the books I came away wanting to read are in this category: *The
Culture  Map*, and Jono Bacon's upcoming book, *People Powered*.

### Diversity and Inclusion


### Burn-out/Team Dynamics
