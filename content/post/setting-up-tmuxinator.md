Several weeks ago, I wrote about [scripting tmux session
startups](/post/scripting-tmux-workspaces/). At the end of the post, I stated
that while writing the post, I had learned about [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) and even teased
that I might be writing about setting up *that* rather soon. Well... I was
right. I've scrapped my tmux shell scripts, and have converted to using
tmuxinator. Here's how.

## What is Tmuxinator?

## Install
Most repos probably have `tmuxinator` in their offical repos. These days, I
mostly use Fedora on all of my machines and I was able to find it there. So to
install on Fedora:

```shell
sudo dnf install termixinator
```

Alternatively, it can be installed using the method on the project's Github
page:

```shell
gem install tmuxinator
```

## Launch
