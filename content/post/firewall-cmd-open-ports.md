As I host more container servies like [jellyfin] and [minecraft servers] on my workstation, I constantly need to open ports for those services. I use to frequently try to connect to a service from another machine, only to freak out as to why it wouldn't load in browser when I *knew* it is running. But I'm learning. Now, I *know* it's likely due to a port being blocked... but often forget how to propely open it up. Well, today is the day I level up again... by finally documenting my steps.

### The Problem

*Image of browser I can't connect to?*

### Open Port

*Code to open the port*

### Reload?

*code to reload/restart firewall config*

### Make it Persistant

*Code with command containing the --permanent flag*

### Conclusion
