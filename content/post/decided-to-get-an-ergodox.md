For the past month, I have been learning to type on... my new keyboard. A few
weeks ago, I purchased an [ergodox-ex](https://ergodox-ez.com) and have been
using it ever since. Why did I want to get a new keyboard (I mean, I still
*love* [my HHKB](/post/new-hhkb-pro2/))? And why... the ergodox?

For a few years, I have been gladly using a [Happy Hacking Pro
2](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2/) keyboard.  Before that, I was
on a [Happy Hacking Lite](https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Lite), which I
started using while in college. I love the layout of HHK and still think it's
an amazing keyboard. The years I spent on HKBs are why I think *every* keyboard
should have `ctrl` instead of a `caps` key, or at least switch to two.


## Rationale for a new one

While I love my HHKB and had no *real* complaints, there were a few things that
pushed me to start looking at new boards again.


### I was getting the itch to build one

My initial motivation was the slow, expanding itch to build a mechanical
keyboard.  It is an itch that I've felt before. I purchased my HHKB Pro as a
*backup* plan when my order for a
[planck](https://olkb.com/collections/planck) keyboard kit via  mass.com was
unfortunately cancelled. My *original* intention was to learn how to soder (I
brought my iron then), and build the keyboard from scratch. Ultimately buying the
HHKB, I never got to scratch that itch. While I *technically* still haven't...
this is what had me looking at keyboards and browsing
[/r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) in the
first place...

### Wanted a program-able board

<div class="caption">The keyboard firmware can be customized on some System76 laptops, as demonstrated during this review.</div>
</center>


More importantly than *physically* building a keyboard, I wanted to be able to
*programatically* build it, that is, play with custom firmware. This is
something that my HHKB doesn't really have, but the plank did. The
[pok3r](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=165),
which I've considered in the past, also had programmable layers. Even some of
[System76's laptops](https://system76.com/laptops) now allow the ability to
remap their keyboards using open firmware (which is awesome!). So, the
*biggest* thing I wanted from a new keyboard was the ability to customize and
program the layers and layouts.


### I started to learn proper touch typing and wanted to try an ortholinear layout

Working in mostly the same space for much of this year, I've noticed that my
wrists and arms have really started to tighten up again. So, I put my foot down
and decided it was time once again to try and force myself to use *proper*
touch typing... using all my fingers. I normally slide my hands across the board
and have just a few fingers do the bulk of the work.  This not only creates
unnessicary movement, but also over strains parts of my hands, building tension
in my wrists.

<div class="caption">'Proper' finger placement for touch typing on a standard
layout</div>
</center>

As I started typing with proper finger use, I noticed my hands *really* have a
hard time hitting some keys... in particular the bottom row, and especially
with my left hand. My other fingers seem to block the path that the "correct"
finger needs to reach a key. It became obvious why I naturally adapted to
sliding across the board over the years. I wondered if an ortholinear layout
would better allow me to touch type properly, using all of my fingers. My hope
was that the straight grid would allow my fingers a more direct slide up and
down to the other rows, with out crossing over in the way of my other fingers.


### My shoulders started really having issues

The last straw that switched my keyboard urgency to something I *needed* to
order *now*, was that my shoulder was starting to hurt... all the time. When I
was split keyboards in my search, I realized they could probably help a lot to
alleviate some of my pain. Being able to type with my arms out at any width
would at least allow me to move the shoulder angle around as it got sore. So, I
switched from looking at DIY planck and similar kits, and started looking at
pre-built split keyboards that I could have shipped, quicker than taking months
to order and build.

## Considerations

With the requirements figured out, I started searching for my keyboard. Both
keyboards I considered are actually made and sold from
[ZSA](https://zsa.io). I chose them because giving the
shoulder problems I was having, I wanted something that would arrive soonish
and already built. Plus, they have very good reviews and seem to be highly
recommended.

### Moonlander

<div class="caption">The Moonlander</div>

The first keyboard I considered was actually the new
[Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/). It had *just* been released. I
loved how it looked with it's floating keys, and slim profile. It was
apparently more portable, coming with it own carrying case. It seemed to
be a fresh new take on the classic ergodox, with a neat folding design and
newer features like usb-c connection.

</center>

I had to dig deep to learn anything about the moonlander as there were only a
handful of people that had them at the time. As I dug, I passively learned
more and more about the ergodox...


### Ergodox-EZ

So the moonlander seems to be a respin of the classic keyboard ZSA also sells,
the [ergodox-ez](https://ergodox-ez.com). The ergodox-ez is a pre-built version
of the well-known (to keyboard nerds...),
[open-source](https://github.com/Ergodox-io), split keyboard, the
[ergodox](https://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox).

While I *really* loved the Moonlander's features and design, I ultimately
decided to go with the ergodox-ez for a couple of reasons:

* The Moonlander is brand-new and there wasn't a whole lot of feedback for it
    yet, whereas the ergodox-ez had a *ton* of *very positive* feedback.

* On a similar note, because the ergodox has been a popular design for a good
    while now, 3rd party parts like new keycaps can be found on [mass.com]() and
    [other locations](). This just made seem a bit more customizable at the
    moment than the Moonlander.

* The ergodox seemed like a great starting board for testing out the
    orthlinear-split design. If there were parts of it I really hated over the
    next few years, I could always switch to a moonlander or other split board,
    based on what I learned with the ergodox.

* If however I instead love the ergodox design and want *another* in a few
    years for some reason, I have the option to *build* one XD.

### Conclusion

So, that it. I picked the Ergodox and have actually had it for a over a month
now. If you are wondering what configuration I selected, as well as what do I
think about it so far... stay tuned for my next post ;) .
