For the past month, I have been learning to type on... my new keyboard. A few
weeks ago, I purchased an [ergodox-ex](https://ergodox-ez.com) and have been
using it ever since. Why did I want to get a new keyboard (I mean, I still
*love* [my HHKB](/post/new-hhkb-pro2/))? And why... the ergodox?

For a few years, I have been gladly using a [Happy Hacking Pro
2](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2/) keyboard.  Before that, I was
on a [Happy Hacking Lite](https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Lite), which I
started using while in college. I love the layout of HHK and still think it's
an amazing keyboard. The years I spent on HKBs are why I think *every* keyboard
should have `ctrl` instead of a `caps` key, or at least switch to two.


## Rationale for a new one

While I love my HHKB and had no *real* complaints, there were a few things that
pushed me to start looking at new boards again.


### I was getting the itch to build one

My initial motivation was the slow, expanding itch to build a mechanical
keyboard.  It is an itch that I've felt before. I purchased my HHKB Pro as a
*backup* plan when my order for a
[planck](https://olkb.com/collections/planck) keyboard kit via  mass.com was
unfortunately cancelled. My *original* intention was to learn how to soder (I
brought my iron then), and build the keyboard from scratch. Ultimately buying the
HHKB, I never got to scratch that itch. While I *technically* still haven't...
this is what had me looking at keyboards and browsing
[/r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) in the
first place...

### Wanted a program-able board

More importantly than *physically* building a keyboard, I wanted to be able to
*programatically* build it, that is, play with custom firmware. This is
something that my HHKB doesn't really have, but the plank did. The
[pok3r](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&c=165),
which I've considered in the past, also had programmable layers. Even some of
[System76's laptops](https://system76.com/laptops) now allow the ability to
remap their keyboards using open firmware (which is awesome!). So, the
*biggest* thing I wanted from a new keyboard was the ability to customize and
program the layers and layouts.


### I started to learn proper touch typing and wanted to try an ortholinear layout

Working in mostly the same space for much of this year, I've noticed that my
wrists and arms have really started to tighten up again. So, I put my foot down
and decided it was time once again to try and force myself to use *proper*
touch typing... using all my fingers. I normally slide my hands across the board
and have just a few fingers do the bulk of the work.  This not only creates
unnessicary movement, but also over strains parts of my hands, building tension
in my wrists.

<div class="caption">'Proper' finger placement for touch typing on a standard
layout</div>
</center>

As I started typing with proper finger use, I noticed my hands *really* have a
hard time hitting some keys... in particular the bottom row, and especially
with my left hand. My other fingers seem to block the path that the "correct"
finger needs to reach a key. It became obvious why I naturally adapted to
sliding across the board over the years. I wondered if an ortholinear layout
would better allow me to touch type properly, using all of my fingers. My hope
was that the straight grid would allow my fingers a more direct slide up and
down to the other rows, with out crossing over in the way of my other fingers.


### My shoulders started really having issues

The last straw, promoting my keyboard urgency to something I *needed* to order
*now*, was that my shoulder was starting to hurt... all the time. During my
search, I started taking notice of split keyboards and realized they coul
potentially help to alleviate some of my pain. The ability to type with my arms
out at any width would at least allow me to move the shoulder angle around as
it got sore. So, I switched from looking at DIY kits to pre-built split
keyboards that I could have shipped and under my fingers much quicker than I
could order and build.


## Considerations

With requirements decided, I started searching for my keyboard. Both keyboards
that I considered are made and sold from the same company,
[ZSA](https://zsa.io). From what I read online, people rated their
products and customer service well, and they were usually highly recommended.
Personally, I loved reading about their focus on
[sustainability](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/sustainability) and creating open
source products.

### Moonlander

The first keyboard that caught my eye was the new
[Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/). When I first saw it, it had
*just* been released. I loved how it's floating keys and slim profile looked.
It was apparently designed to be at least somewhat portable, coming with it own
carrying case. It seemed to be a fresh new take on the classic ergodox, with a
clever folding design and newer features like usb-c connection.

I had to dig deep to learn anything about the moonlander as there were only a
handful of people that had them at the time. As I dug, I passively learned
more and more about the ergodox...


### Ergodox-EZ

The moonlander is sort of a re-spin of one of the other keyboards ZSA sells,
the [ergodox-ez](https://ergodox-ez.com). The ergodox-ez is a pre-built version
of the well-known (to keyboard nerds...),
[open-source](https://github.com/Ergodox-io), split keyboard, the
[ergodox](https://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox).

I loved the Moonlander's features and design, but I ultimately
decided to go with the ergodox-ez for a couple of reasons:

* The Moonlander is brand-new and there wasn't much feedback for it
    yet, [whereas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA) [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GPHiJMS7eo) [is](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/comfortable-ergo-keyboard/) [plenty](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/03/03/why-this-300-ergonomic-keyboard-might-actually-be-worth-the-money/) [of](https://www.rtings.com/keyboard/reviews/ergodox/ez) [information](https://www.mmorpg.com/hardware-reviews/ergodox-ez-this-is-what-powerful-looks-like-2000107228) [about](https://matteeyah.com/ergodox-ez-keyboard) the ergodox-ez.

* On a similar note, because the ergodox has been a popular design for a good
    while now, 3rd party parts like new keycaps specifically for the ergodox
    can easily be found on [mass.com](https://www.mass.com/) and [other
    websites](http://www.mechsupply.co.uk). This makes the ergodox a bit easier
    to customize than the moonlander, at least currently.

* The ergodox is great starting board for testing out the
    orthlinear+split design. If there were parts of it I really hated over the
    next few years, I could always switch to a moonlander or another split board that better fits my needs,
    based on what I learn from the ergodox.

* However, if I instead *love* the ergodox design and want *another* in a few
    years for some reason, I still have the option to *build* one.. and *finally*
    scratch that itch XD.

### Conclusion

I ordered the Ergodox-ez and have had it for a over a month now. If you are
wondering what configuration I selected, and what I think about it so far...
stay tuned for my next post ;) .
