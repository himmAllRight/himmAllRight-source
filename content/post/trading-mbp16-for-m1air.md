Over a year has passed since I purchased a [base model 2019 16" Macbook
Pro](/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/). My first Mac. With it's large "retina"
display, resurrected magic keyboard, and truly *amazing* speakers, it might
be the most pleasurable laptop I have ever owned. However, I decided to trade
it in... for a new MacBook *air*. Here's why.

## Background

<div class="caption">Installing macOS Catalina on my wife's old macbook air for my mac challenge</div>

In the Fall of 2019, I decided to do a [30 day macOS](/post/macos-challenge/)
challenge. During the challenge, I learned that while I think Linux is still
my go-to and *indispensable* OS, I did enjoy having a mac available for doing
more ["normal life computing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKiAnxjM8Nc).
Web browsing, writing emails, managing calendars, personal finance, planning
home projects with my wife, ssh'ing into your servers to code... that type of
stuff.

After the challenge, I decided to acquire a mac for myself. I choose the 16" MBP
*mostly* because it was the only macbook at the time with the new keyboard.
That was a hard requirement I had. I wouldn't even consider buying a
butterfly keyboard macbook. Keyboard aside, as my *only* Mac, I did want it
to be powerful enough to be my 'workstation' mac/laptop. And it was.

<div class="caption">While the 16" MacBook Pro did improve cooling compared to it's predecessor, it was still too warm for my tastes</div>

After a few month of use, a problem emerged from having that power... I didn't use it. As I discovered
[the last time I had a more "workstation laptop"](/post/sold-my-bonobo/), I
don't like when my computers heat up and spin up their fans. The 16" macbook
was relatively thin for the amount of power it had (did you see the size of
my previous workstaion laptop!?!?). However, that sleek design came at a
cost. While the re-designed cooling on the 16" was considered quite good for
a macbook... it didn't meet my standards.

<div class="caption">While using the CPU (importing photos), the temps stayed at 80C with turbo boost (still to high!). After enabling it, the temps shot up to 100C!</div>

I eventually purchased and installed [turbo boost
switcher](http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com) a couple months ago, to *disable
the turbo boost on my cpu* This ran the cpu at it's base clock, without
boosting it up for more 'bursty' performance. This didn't seem to hinder my
small day-to-day usage, and in my mind was more than worth the trade to keep
the computer a little bit cooler, and prevent the fans from spinning up all
the time. It was just such a shame to pay so much money for that powerful of
a computer... and then purposefully hinder it.


## The M1 Macs are Released

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png"><img alt="Apple's M1 Announcement" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Apple announced it's first Apple Silicon CPU, the M1</div>

Then, this past November, Apple announced the new M1 Macs, the first
computers in the company's planned 2 transition to switch from Intel CPUs to
Apple's own "Apple Silicon" arm processors. And they were a hit.

While I was skeptical about the smoothness of a cpu architecture switch early
reviewers indicated that Apple had handled it extremely well. This had me
tempted to immediately swap my MBP in for one of the newer ones. I decided to
hold out for a bit, considering that my 16" computer was still an *amazing*
laptop that was more than capable of what I needed it for.

That being said, the seeds of question *how* I use a mac, and *what for* had
been planted.

## How I use a Mac

I started to map out what my Mac use-cases in two broad categories: *What* I use my mac for, and *Where* I use it. After some brainstorming, I had the following lists:


#### What I use a Mac For

I most commonly use my Mac for:

- Utilizing Apple ecosystem apps and services (Notes, Reminders, Photos, GarageBand, Music, Etc)
- Web Browsing
- Online Courses
- SSH and/or VS Code (I do coding, writing, and all those other tasks on my workstation, and remote in when on my macbook)
- Personal Planning/organizing, emails
- Listen to podcasts or music
- Watching videos or livestreams
- Chating with Friends and Family
- *Maybe* a light game if I'm on the go or not at my desk 


#### Where I use a MacBook

<div class="caption">As my main laptop, my MacBook occasionally has to serve as my portable workstation</div>


Being both my *only* Mac, as well as my main portable computer, there is actually quite a range of *where* and *how* I use my macbook. Some examples include:

 - Portable: I use it as my portable machine, in a few types of locations:
    - Sitting on the couch
    - At a Table
    - At a table on a stand w/ Keyboard, and possibly other external displays
- As my single portable workstation if I visit family or something
- As my Mac desktop, conected to all the devices at my desk via a thunderbolt hub.


### Best Tool for the Job

*This section really need to be trimmed and possible a picture added*

The discrepancy that really stood out to me while makings these lists, was
that I generally try to use appropriate hardware for my uses (for the most
part). Looking over what I wrote it really felt bad to have a $2000+ laptop
for what I use it for. I did *not* need that much for my *secondary
computer*, even if I loved the speakers and screen. If this was my *main*
compouter, it would be perfect. But it isn't. I have a powerful linux
workstation for my heavy lifting and complicated, virtual workloads. Hell,
macOS isn't even my power OS. I do all my power user computing on Linux...
even if it's *from* my mac (I `ssh` into my workstation for nearly
everything... even writing these posts). To summarize, I realized that while
it *meets* my computing needs, I don't need a massive MBP to run a web
browser, macos apps, and a dumb terminal.


### MBP vs. Air

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg"><img alt="Both Macs, closed on table" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The 2019 16" MacBook Pro and the 2020 M1 Macbook Air</div>

After hammering out my macbook use-cases, I theorized how a M1 macbook air
might compare to my mbp in meeting these needs. I came up with the following
conclusions:

- While I do occasionally use some of the mac's heavier software (garageband,
imovie, Photos, and others), the performance of the M1 is more than enough
than what I would need it for, and even beats my intel mbp.
- It wouldn't benefit me too much to wait for more powerful M1s, because my
needs are already passed for what I need this device to do.
- The dedicated GPU in the mbp also doesn't benefit me, as I do all my gaming
in a windows VM on my workstation. In fact, it actually *hurts* my experience
by generating excess heat and kicking up the fans.
    - The air's gpu is also enough for what I need, as it seems to even
    handle the occasional low end game (which are what I mostly play).
    - And on that note... the air doesn't even *have* a fan to spin up...

Overall, the Air is able to do most things at right around the same level,
or sometimes, in the case of portability and noise for example, **much**
better than my macbook pro. Most of the things the mbp is better at, aren't
actually as important for my use.


## Decided to Go for it

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png"><img alt="Current trade-in-value" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">I knew my trade-in value would only get worse, and I didn't *need* to wait for the new 16" Pro to come out</div>

Eventually, I decided to do the trade-in. My reasons were mainly that:

1. The current trade in price would cover the price of the "higher end" M1
Macbook Air, and I would only have to pay tax and for any other updgrades I
wanted to make.

2. With that said, I knew I was m slowly getting less and less value for my
MBP. I figured once the M1 16" MBP was released, the value for mine would
plummet.

So I ordered the air, but bumped up a few specs so it matched my mbp's 16GB
RAM and 512GB ssd. If I was going to be be "downgrading" from a mbp to an
air, I at least wanted to keep the same amount of RAM and storage that I had
before. It took almost a month to arrive, but now it's here, and I'm shipping up
the MBP to send back.

I need this *secondary computer* to function as my portable laptop, and my
only Mac. I think the m1 air will fill all of these roles amazingly. If I
needed a laptop to be my *main* machine... I would probably keep the MBP and wait for
the newer Apple Silicon version to be released, and upgrade then.

## Conclusion

The 2019 16" MacBook Pro was and still is an amazing machine, and I will miss
it. Ultimately though, it was the combination of the M1 macs being *very*
good, and the fact that a *good* air-like laptop actually fit my use case
better is what finalized this decision.
