It has been over a year since I bought [my first MacBook](), a base model
2019 16" Macbook Pro. Honestly, with it's 'retina' display, *acceptable*
keyboard, and truely *amazing* speakers, it might be the most pleasurable
laptop I have owned. However, recently I decided to trade it in... for a
MacBook *air*. Here's why.

<div class="caption">Installing macOS Catalina on my wife's old macbook air for a mac challenge</div>

During the Fall of 2019, I decided to do a [30 day
macOS](/post/macos-challenge/) challenge. My take
away was that while I think Linux is still my go-to and must-have OS, I did
enjoy having a mac available for doing more [normal
computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKiAnxjM8Nc). You know, working on email, calendars, browsing, personal finance, planning home projects with the wife, ssh'ing into your servers... that type of stuff.

After the challenge, I decided to get a mac for myself. I picked the 16" MBP
*mostly* because it was the only macbook with the new keyboard at the time.
This was a hard requirement for me. I wouldn't have even considered buying a
macbook if it had a butterfly keyboard. Also, as my *only* Mac, I wanted it
to be powerful enough to be my 'workstation' mac/laptop. And it was.

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png"><img alt="the mbp had better cooling" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mbp_cooling.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">While the 16" MacBook Pro did improve cooling compared to it's predecessor, it was still too warm for my tastes</div>

There was problem with having that power... I didn't use it. As I discovered
[the last time I had a more "workstation laptop"](/post/sold-my-bonobo/), I
don't like when my computers heat up and turn up their fans. The 16" macbook
was relatively thin for the amount of power it had (did you see the size of
my previous workstaion laptop!?!?). However, that sleek design came at a
cost. While the re-designed cooling on the 16" was considered quite good for
a macbook... it didn't meet my standards.

<div class="caption">While using the CPU (importing photos), the temps stayed at 80C with turbo boost (still to high!). After enabling it, the temps shot up to 100C!</div>

I eventually purchased and installed [turbo boost
switcher](http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com) a couple months ago, to *disable
the turbo boost on my cpu* This ran the cpu at it's base clock, without
boosting it up for more 'bursty' performance. This didn't seem to hinder my
small day-to-day usage, and in my mind was more than worth the trade to keep
the computer a little bit cooler, and prevent the fans from spinning up all
the time. It was just such a shame to pay so much money for that powerful of
a computer... and then purposefully hinder it.


## The M1 Macs are Released

*Stock Photo of M1?*

- I was intrigued by the M1's when they were announced thought about doing the switch then.
- However, I didn't know what the support would be like
- Also... the MBP is still an AMAZING laptop, and I could easily wait until the M1 versions of the new 16" came out


## How I use a Mac


### What I use a Mac For

*Photo/Screenshot of normal mac apps opened?*

- But then I started to think about what I *actually* need/use my mac for.
    - Apple environment computer and tools (Notes, Photoes, GarageBand, Reminders)
    - Web Browsing/Learning
    - SSH (I do coding, writing, and all those other tasks on my workstation, remotely from my macbook)
    - Planning/organizing, emails
    - Listen to podcasts, musics, watch videos and livestreams
    - Chat with Friends and Family
    - *Maybe* a light game if I'm on the go or something

### Where I use a MacBook
- I also thought about *where* I need to use a MacbBook:
 - Portable: I use it as my portable machine, in a few types of locations:
    - Sitting on the couch, as. LAPTOP
    - At a Table
    - At a table on a stand w/ Keyboard, and possibly other external displays
- As my single AIO portable workstation if I visit family or something
- As my Mac computer, at my desk on a stand and connected to all my devices


### Best Tool for the Job
- I try to use appropriate hardware for my uses (to an extent), and it really felt bad to use a $2000+ laptop when I used it like I did. I did *not* need it, even though I loved the speakers and screen. If it was my main machine, it would be perfect. But it isn't. I have a powerful linux workstation for my heavy lifting. Hell, macOS isn't even my power OS. When I heavy compute, it's on Linux... even if it's *from* my mac (I `ssh` into my workstation for nearly everything... even writing these posts).
- I don't need a massive MBP for a web browser, macos apps, and a dumb terminal.

*I could possibly have photos of it in these scenarios...*


### MBP vs. Air

- While I do occasionally use and have intentions to use some of the mac's heavier software (garageband/logic, imovie/final cut, and others), the performance of the M1 is more than enough than what I would need it for, and even beats my intel mbp. 
- It also wouldn't benefit me too much to wait for more powerful M1s, because my needs are already passed for this device.
- The dedicated GPU in the mbp also doesn't benefit me, as I do my gaming in a windows VM on my workstation. In fact, it actually hurts my experience by generating excess heat and kicking up the fans
    - The air's gpu is also enough for what I need, as it seems to even handle the occasional low end game (which are what I mostly play).
- Overall, the Air is able to do most things at right around the same level, or sometimes, in the case of portability and noise for example, **much** better.


## Decided to Go for it

*Screenshot of Current MBP Trade-In Value*

- I'm slowly getting less and less value for my MBP

- I figure once the M1 16" MBP is released, the value of mine will plummit,
possibly even with Apple trade-in since it would no longer be the "current"
model...

- So I ordered the air, but bumped up a few specs so it matched my mbp's 16GB
RAM and 512GB ssd. I at least wanted that the same if I was going to already
be "downgrading" from a mbp to an air...

- It took almost a month to arrive, but now it's here, and I'm shipping up
the MBP to send back.

- The 16 was and still is an amazing machine, and I will miss it. However,
the m1 air is also a remarkable machine, and actually fits my current needs a
bit better. 

- I need it as my portable laptop, *secondary* computer, and my mac. I think
the m1 air will fill all of those roles amazingly. If I needed a laptop to be my *main* machine... I would probably be waiting for newer M1s to be released.

- Ultimately, it was the combination of the M1 macs being *very* good, combined with the fact that an air-like laptop actually fit my use case better (assuming it was good), is what finalized this decision.

But more on those thoughts later...
