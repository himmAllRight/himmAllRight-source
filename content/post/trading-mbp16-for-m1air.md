## Background

- I did a macOS challenge and liked it a bit for my "normal" computing
- I ended up getting my first mac over a year ago
- I picked the 16" MBP mostly because it was the only one with the new keyboard at the time (a hard req. for me), and because I figured it could be my good 'workstation' mac/laptop. And it was. 


- However, I don't use my mbp to it's fullest, as I'm very noise and heat aware, and actually *disable turbo boost* on my mbp... Talk about wasted power...

## The M1 is released

- I was intrigued by the M1's when they were announced thought about doing the switch then.
- However, I didn't know what the support would be like
- Also... the MBP is still an AMAZING laptop, and I could easily wait until the M1 versions of the new 16" came out


## What I use/need my macbook for

- But then I started to think about what I *actually* need/use my mac for.
- I try to use appropriate hardware for my uses (to an extent), and it really felt bad to use a $2000+ laptop when I used it like I did. I did *not* need it, even though I loved the speakers and screen. If it was my main machine, it would be perfect. But it isn't. I have a powerful linux workstation for my heavy lifting. Hell, macOS isn't even my power OS. When I heavy compute, it's on Linux... even if it's *from* my mac (I `ssh` into my workstation for nearly everything... even writing these posts).
- I don't need a massive MBP for a web browser, macos apps, and a dumb terminal.


### MBP vs. Air

- While I do occasionally use and have intentions to use some of the mac's heavier software (garageband/logic, imovie/final cut, and others), the performance of the M1 is more than enough than what I would need it for, and even beats my intel mbp. 
- It also wouldn't benefit me too much to wait for more powerful M1s, because my needs are already passed for this device.
- The dedicated GPU in the mbp also doesn't benefit me, as I do my gaming in a windows VM on my workstation. In fact, it actually hurts my experience by generating excess heat and kicking up the fans
    - The air's gpu is also enough for what I need, as it seems to even handle the occasional low end game (which are what I mostly play).
- Overall, the Air is able to do most things at right around the same level, or sometimes, in the case of portability and noise for example, **much** better.


## Decided to Go for it

- I'm slowly getting less and less value for my MBP

- I figure once the M1 16" MBP is released, the value of mine will plummit,
possibly even with Apple trade-in since it would no longer be the "current"
model...

- So I ordered the air, but bumped up a few specs so it matched my mbp's 16GB
RAM and 512GB ssd. I at least wanted that the same if I was going to already
be "downgrading" from a mbp to an air...

- It took almost a month to arrive, but now it's here, and I'm shipping up
the MBP to send back.

- The 16 was and still is an amazing machine, and I will miss it. However,
the m1 air is also a remarkable machine, and actually fits my current needs a
bit better. But more on those thoughts later...
