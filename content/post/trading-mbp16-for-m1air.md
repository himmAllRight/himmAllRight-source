Over a year has passed since I purchased a [base model 2019 16" MacBook
Pro](/post/new-2019-16inch-mbp/). My first Mac. With it's large "retina"
display, resurrected magic keyboard, and truly *amazing* speakers, it might
be the most pleasurable laptop I have ever owned. However, I decided to trade
it in... for a new MacBook *air*. Here's why.

## Background

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg"><img alt="Installing macOS Cataline on old air" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/mac_challenge.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Installing macOS Catalina on my wife's old MacBook Air for my Mac challenge</div>

In the Fall of 2019, I decided to do a [30 day macOS](/post/macos-challenge/)
challenge. During the challenge, I learned that while I think Linux is still
my go-to and *indispensable* OS, I did enjoy having a mac available for doing
more ["normal life computing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKiAnxjM8Nc).
Web browsing, writing emails, managing calendars, personal finance, planning
home projects with my wife, ssh'ing into servers to code... that type of
stuff.

After the challenge, I decided to acquire a mac for myself. I choose the 16"
MBP *mostly* because it was the only MacBook at the time with the new magic
keyboard. That was a hard requirement I had. I wouldn't even consider buying
a butterfly MacBook. Keyboard aside, as my *only* Mac, I did want it
to be powerful enough to be my 'workstation' mac/laptop. And it was.

<div class="caption">While the 16" MacBook Pro did improve cooling compared to it's predecessor, it was still too warm for my tastes</div>

After a few months of use, a problem emerged regarding that power... I didn't utilize it. As I discovered
[the last time I had a more "workstation laptop"](/post/sold-my-bonobo/), I
don't like when my computers overheat and spin up their fans. The 16" macbook
was relatively thin for its specs (did you see the size of
my previous workstaion laptop!?!?). However, that sleek design came at a
cost. While the re-designed cooling on the 16" was considered quite good for
a MacBook... it didn't meet my standards.

<div class="caption">While using the CPU (importing photos), the temps stayed at 80C with turbo boost disabled. After enabling it, the temps shot up to 100C!</div>

I eventually purchased and installed [turbo boost
switcher](http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com), to *disable turbo boost on my
cpu* This runs the cpu at it's base clock, without boosting it up for more
'bursty' performance. This didn't seem to hinder my small day-to-day usage,
and in my mind, was more than worth the trade to keep the computer a little
bit cooler, and prevent the fans from spinning up all the time. It was just a
shame to pay so much money for such powerful computer... and then
purposefully hinder it.


## The M1 Macs are Released

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png"><img alt="Apple's M1 Announcement" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/m1_released.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Apple announced it's first Apple Silicon CPU, the M1</div>

Then, in November, Apple announced the new M1 Macs, the first
computers in the company's planned 2 transition to switch from Intel CPUs to
Apple's own "Apple Silicon" arm processors. And they were a hit.

While I was skeptical about the smoothness of a cpu architecture switch, early
reviewers indicated that Apple handled it extremely well. This had me
tempted to immediately swap my MBP in for one of the newer ones. But, I decided to
hold out for a bit, reasoning that my 16" computer was still an *amazing*
laptop that was more than capable of what I needed it for.

Still, the seed of questioning *how* I use a mac had been planted.

## How I use a Mac

I started to map out my Mac use-cases in two broad categories: *What* I
use my mac for, and *where* I use it. After some brainstorming, I had the
following lists:


#### *What* I use a Mac For

I most commonly use my Mac for:

- Utilizing Apple apps and services (Messages, FaceTime, Notes, Reminders,
Photos, GarageBand, Music, iCloud, Etc)
- Web Browsing
- Online Courses/Proctored Exams
- SSH and/or VS Code (I do coding, writing, and all those other tasks on my workstation, and remote in when on my MacBook)
- Personal Planning/organizing, emails
- Listen to podcasts or music
- Watching videos or livestreams
- Chatting with Friends and Family 
- *Maybe* a light game if I'm on the go or not at my desk (possibly streamed from my gaming VM)


#### *Where* I use a MacBook

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg"><img alt="Macbook on a stand" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/macbook_stand.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">As my main laptop, my MacBook occasionally has to serve as my portable workstation</div>


Being both my *only* Mac, as well as my main portable computer, there is
actually quite a range of *where* and *how* I setup my MacBook. Some examples
include:

 - Portable: I use it as my portable machine, in a few types of locations:
    - Sitting on the couch
    - At a Table, by itself
    - At a table on a stand w/ Keyboard, and possibly other external displays
- As my single portable workstation if I travel or visit family 
- As my Mac 'desktop', connected to all the devices at my desk via a thunderbolt hub.


### Best Tool for the Job

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg"><img alt="Using my macbook while running benchmarks on my desktop" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/desktop_benchmarking.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">Using my MBP while running benchmarks on my desktop
after <u>[some upgrades](/post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/)</u>. Dispite
its pwer, my Mac is a *secondary* computer.</div>

A disparity stood out to me while makings these lists. I
generally try to use appropriate hardware for my need (at least within
reason). Looking over what I wrote, it felt weird to have a $2000+ laptop for
what I use it for. I did *not* need that much for my *secondary computer*,
even if I loved the speakers and screen.

If this was my *main* computer, it would be fine. But it isn't. I have a
[powerful linux workstation](/post/selecting-charmeleons-upgrades/) for my
heavy lifting and complicated, virtual workloads. Hell, macOS isn't even my
main OS. I do all my power-user computing on Linux... even if it's *from* my
mac (as previously stated, I `ssh` into my desktop for nearly everything...
including writing these posts). The MBP *met* the role I needed it for, but
it didn't necessarily
*fit* that role.

### 16" MBP vs. Air

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg"><img alt="Both Macs, closed on table" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/both_macs_closed.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">The 2019 16" MacBook Pro and the 2020 M1 Macbook Air</div>

After hammering out my MacBook use cases, I theorized how a M1 MacBook Air
might compare to my 16" MBP in meeting those needs. I came up with the following
conclusions:

- While I do occasionally use some of the mac's heavier software (garageband,
imovie, Photos, and others), the performance of the M1 is more than enough
for what I would need it to do, and even *beats* my Intel MBP on some tasks.
- It wouldn't benefit me to wait for more powerful Apple Silicon Macs,
as my needs are already passed for what I need this device to do. Even
if an Apple Silicon 16" MBP *was* available, tempting as it might be, I've
already established it isn't a good fit for this device.
- While I would miss the screen space and speakers, the air would be *much*
more portable. Not only would this be great when traveling, but it would also
be appreciated when picking it up with one hand to take into another room.
- The dedicated GPU in the MBP doesn't really benefit me, as I do all my
gaming in a Windows VM on my workstation. In fact, it may actually *hurt* my
experience by generating excess heat and kicking up the fans.
- And on that note... the air doesn't even *have* a fan to spin up, and
doesn't appear to get too warm either. Unlike the M1 MBP, it *will* throttle
to cool the CPU during sustained workloads, but we've already established
that I am *currently* doing that on my 16" anyway ☺︎.

Overall, I concluded that the Air should be able to do most of the tasks my
16" MBP does, at around the same level of perfomrance, if not better. In the
case of portability and noise, the air would be **much** better suited than
my Pro. Additionally, most of the workloads the MBP *is* better at,
aren't as important for my needs.


## Decided to Go for it

<a href="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png"><img alt="Current trade-in-value" src="../../img/posts/trading-mbp16-for-m1air/trade-in-value.png" style="max-width: 100%;"/></a>
<div class="caption">I knew my trade-in value would only get worse, and I didn't need to wait for the new 16" Pro to come out</div>

Eventually, I decided to make the trade-in. My main reasons were:

1. The current trade-in price would cover the cost of the "higher end" M1
Macbook Air, and I would only have to pay tax and for any other updgrades I
wanted to make.

2. I knew I would slowly get less and less for my MBP. I figured once a new
16" MBP was released, the value for mine would likely plummet.

So, I ordered the higher tier Air ( with 8gpu cores + 512GB of storage),
and bumped up the RAM to 16GB. If I was going to be be "downgrading"
from a MBP to an Air, I wanted to at least keep the same amount of RAM and
storage that I had before. It took almost a month to arrive, but now it's
here, and I'm packing up the MBP to send back.

I need this secondary computer to function as my portable laptop, and only
(physical) Mac. I think the m1 air will fill both of these roles extremely
well. If I needed a laptop to be my *main* machine... I would have probably
kept the MBP and upgrade after a newer Apple Silicon version is released.

The 2019 16" MacBook Pro was, and still is, an amazing machine. I *will* miss
it. Ultimately though, a combination of the M1 Macs being *very* good, and
the fact that a smaller, thin and light laptop fit my use case best,
finalized my decision to switch.
