Not too long ago, I switched out home networking equipment to an Ubiqui setup
that I loved. However, after recently moving into a new house, I will be
switching to a mesh wifi network setup... and no, it is not *just* to increase
wifi coverage throughout the house (although that is an added benefit). The
real reason (ironically)... is because I need a better ethernet connection...
