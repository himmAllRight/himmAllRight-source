Not too long ago, I switched out home networking equipment to an Ubiqui setup
that I loved. However, after recently moving into a new house, I will be
switching to a mesh wifi network setup... and no, it is not *just* to increase
wifi coverage throughout the house (although that is an added benefit). The
real reason (ironically)... is because I need a better ethernet connection...

### History

About two years ago, I [replaced my Linksys wifi
router(s)](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/upgrading-network-to-ubiquiti/)
with the tiny-but-mighty [Ubiquity Edge Router
X](https://store.ui.com/products/edgerouter-x), paired with the [Ubiqui AP AC
lite](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/) wifi access point. I loved
it. It handled our web traffic flawlessly, and unlike the previous Linksys
routers, I never had to randomly restart it. It just worked for months on end.

I enjoyed the setup *so* much in fact, that while I was thrilled to have a Google
Fiber internet connection in our apartment when we moved to Durham NC last
year... I was a little sad that setting up the edgerouter on the fiber
connection required a little bit of tweaking. I looked into it but ultimately
decided that figuring it out wasn't worth the hassel for the short period of
time which we'd likely live in the apartment. So I reluctantly used the Google
provided box.

### We Moved
The Google fiber was indeed short lived, as my wife and I just moved into a
house this past month. When working with Spectrum (yea... I know), we
discovered that while there were coax plugs in both the living room and
master bedroom... we couldn't actually find any hook-ups to connect the house
to the cable/internet service line.

#### Cable line in Bedroom
After searching with multiple techs, we decided just to have them drill a line
into the master bedroom (which is at the back of the house and means the
connection box can be next to the other meters). Our house isn't massive and
having the router in the bedroom works well enough except for one issue.

I tend to have several servers and desktop computers that I *need* to connect
to ethernet (either because they don't have wifi cards, and/or because I rely
on Wake-On-Lan technologies with them). This means that I need an ethernet
connection in my office... at the front of the house. With the only ethernet
router/switch being in the bedroom and the rest of the house relying on wifi...
I needed to figure something out.

#### Powerline Issues
In past apartments, I had used powerline ethernet adaptors to extend ethernet
from a router in a different room to my computers. The speeds weren't great
but, then again neither was our connection so it wasn't a huge deal. This time
around though I ran some tests...

##### Tri-band acting as "wireless" ethernet bridge :P
