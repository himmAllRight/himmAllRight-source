Not too long ago, I switched out home networking equipment to an Ubiqui setup
that I loved. However, after recently moving into a new house, I will be
switching to a mesh wifi network setup... and no, it is not *just* to increase
wifi coverage throughout the house (although that is an added benefit). The
real reason (ironically)... is because I need a better ethernet connection...

### History

About two years ago, I [replaced my Linksys wifi
router(s)](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/post/upgrading-network-to-ubiquiti/)
with the tiny-but-mighty [Ubiquity Edge Router
X](https://store.ui.com/products/edgerouter-x), paired with the [Ubiqui AP AC
lite](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/) wifi access point. I loved
it. It handled our web traffic flawlessly, and unlike the previous Linksys
routers, I never had to randomly restart it. It just worked for months on end.

I enjoyed the setup *so* much in fact, that while I was thrilled to have a Google
Fiber internet connection in our apartment when we moved to Durham NC last
year... I was a little sad that setting up the edgerouter on the fiber
connection required a little bit of tweaking. I looked into it but ultimately
decided that figuring it out wasn't worth the hassel for the short period of
time which we'd likely live in the apartment. So I reluctantly used the Google
provided box.

### We Moved

#### Cable line in Bedroom

#### Powerline Issues

#### Mesh Network?

#### Orbi

##### Tri-band acting as "wireless" ethernet bridge :P
