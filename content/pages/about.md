I am a Quality Engineer at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com),
living and working in [Durham, NC](https://durhamnc.gov/). Previously,
I worked at [2Is-Inc](http://2is-inc.com/) as a Back-end Software Developer,
creating applications and build systems (mostly in [Allegro Common
Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/)). Before that, I
was a student at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/),
where I majored in Neuroscience and minored in Computer Science.

Outside of work, I am still an enthusiastic Linux user that loves
learning about computers, programming languages (especially functional ones),
and open source technologies. I am particularly interested in containers,
immutable infrastructure,  and automation.

I am a self-taught learner and continue to study computer science and IT topics
by working on [personal](https://gitlab.com/himmAllRight/)
[projects](https://github.com/himmAllRight?tab=repositories), taking courses,
and maintaining my [homelab](/pages/homelab/). This website exists to help
document the projects I work on, and what I've learned.

Beyond technology, I love [music](https://bandcamp.com/himmallright),
[writing](/post/), the outdoors, and swimming (I
competitively swam from the age of 8, through college). I am married to
Rebecca, a third year [Anaesthesia](https://anesthesia.mc.duke.edu/) resident
at Duke. We have been together for over 13 years and were married on September
17th, 2016 (the day before our 10th anniversary).
