I am a 26 year-old software developer working at a Walpole MA based
company (although I recently moved to Durham NC), that heavily
utilizes [Allegro Common
Lisp](http://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/) for its
applications. I primarily focus on our back-end build and deployment
infrastructure, but as with any small company, I wear many hats and
jump around assisting wherever I am needed.

Outside of work, I am an enthusiastic Linux user that loves learning
about computers, programming languages (especially functional ones),
and open source technologies. I majored in Neuroscience with a minor
in Computer Science at [Lafayette
College](https://www.lafayette.edu/), but am mostly a self-taught
learner and continue to study computer science and IT topics by
working on [personal
projects](https://github.com/himmAllRight?tab=repositories), taking
courses, and maintaining my
[homelab](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/pages/homelab/). This website
exists to help document the personal projects I work on, and what I've
learned.

Beyond technology, I love music, writing, the outdoors, and swimming
(I competitively swam from the age of 8, through college). I am
married to my wife Rebecca, an amazing first year Duke medical
resident ([Anesthesiology](https://anesthesia.mc.duke.edu/)). We have
been together for almost 12 years and were married on September 17th,
2016 (the day before our 10th anniversary).
