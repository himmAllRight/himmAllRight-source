I am a 26 year-old software developer working in Walpole MA. I work at a company that predominantly develops in [Allegro Common Lisp](http://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/), as a member of the applications team. I primarily focus on our back-end build and deployment infrastructure but, as with any small company, I wear many hats and jump around assisting in whatever is needed.

Outside of work, I am an enthusiastic Linux user that loves learning about computers,
programming languages (especially functional ones), and open source technologies. While I majored in Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/), I am largely a self-taught learner and continue to study computer science and IT topics by working on on [personal projects](https://github.com/himmAllRight?tab=repositories), taking courses, and maintaining my [homelab](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/pages/homelab/). This website exists to help document the personal projects I work on, and what I've learned.

Beyond technology, I love music, reading, hiking, and swimming (I competitively swam from the age of 8, through college). I am married to an amazing fourth year Medical Student at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. We have been together for ~11 years and [were married](http://wedding.himmelwright.net) on September 17th, 2016 (the day before our 10th anniversary).
