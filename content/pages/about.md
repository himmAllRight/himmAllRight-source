I am a Quality Engineer at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com),
living and working in [Durham, NC](https://durhamnc.gov/). Previously,
I worked at [2Is-Inc](http://2is-inc.com/) as a Back-end Software Developer,
creating applications and build systems (mostly in [Allegro Common
Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/)). Before that, I
was a student at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/),
where I majored in Neuroscience and minored in Computer Science.

Outside of work, I am still an enthusiastic Linux user that loves
learning about computers, programming languages (especially functional
ones), and open source technologies. I am an active member of [Code
for Durham](http://codefordurham.com/), and also frequent [several
other](https://trilug.org/) [local
meet ups](https://www.meetup.com/TriClojure) [in
the](https://www.meetup.com/learn-code-rdu/) [triangle
area](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Kubernetes-Meetup/).

I am a self-taught learner and continue to study computer science and
IT topics by working on [personal
projects](https://github.com/himmAllRight?tab=repositories), taking
courses, and maintaining my
[homelab](/pages/homelab/). This website
exists to help document the personal projects I work on, and what I've
learned.

Beyond technology, I love [music](https://bandcamp.com/himmallright),
[writing](/post/), the outdoors, and swimming (I
competitively swam from the age of 8, through college). I am married to
Rebecca, a second year [Anaesthesia](https://anesthesia.mc.duke.edu/) resident
at Duke. We have been together for over 13 years and were married on September
17th, 2016 (the day before our 10th anniversary).
