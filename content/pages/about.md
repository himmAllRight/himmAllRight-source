I am a 26 year-old software developer working at a company based in
Walpole MA (although I recently moved to Durham NC), that heavily utilizes
[Allegro Common Lisp](http://franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/)
for our applications. I primarily focus on our back-end build and
deployment infrastructure, but as with any small company, I wear many
hats and jump around assisting wherever I am needed.

Outside of work, I am an enthusiastic Linux user that loves learning about computers,
programming languages (especially functional ones), and open source technologies. I majored in Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science at [Lafayette College](https://www.lafayette.edu/), but am mostly a self-taught learner and continue to study computer science and IT topics by working on [personal projects](https://github.com/himmAllRight?tab=repositories), taking courses, and maintaining my [homelab](http://ryan.himmelwright.net/pages/homelab/). This website exists to help document the personal projects I work on, and what I've learned.

Beyond technology, I love music, writing, the outdoors, and swimming
(I competitively swam from the age of 8, through college). I am
married to Rebecca, an amazing first year Duke medical resident
([Anesthesiology](https://anesthesia.mc.duke.edu/)). We have been
together for 12 years and were married on September 17th, 2016 (the
day before our 10th anniversary).

This summer, Rebecca will start her medical residency in  at Duke University Medical Center, so we will be moving to  in June.
